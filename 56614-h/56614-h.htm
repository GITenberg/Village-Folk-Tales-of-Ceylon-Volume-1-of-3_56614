<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the forest and jungle of north-central or
north-western Ceylon is viewed from the upper part of a hill of
considerable height, it has the appearance of a dark green sea, across
which, if there be any wind, waves closely resembling those of the
ocean roll along in parallel lines as the swaying tree tops bend under
the gusts of the breeze. As clouds pass between it and the sun their
shadows of darker green follow each other over this seemingly
illimitable ocean. The undulations of the ground are lost; all appears
to be at one general level, except that here and there a little island
is visible where a low rocky mound succeeds in raising its head above
the verdant waves.</p>
<p>Any hills of lower elevation than our post of observation look
strangely dwarfed, while higher ones behind us stand out more
prominently than ever. In the immediate neighbourhood, perhaps glimpses
may be obtained of one or two pale green rice fields, contrasting with
the darker foliage around them, and of the light blue reflection of the
sky in the water of a village tank; but further away there is no break
in the uniformity of the forest sea. No houses are to be seen nor
sounds heard, and the visible country appears to be an uninhabited
silent wilderness of vegetation.</p>
<p>Let us descend from such an elevated post, and proceed to examine
the depths of the green ocean at closer quarters. I shall assume that
the reader is accompanying me on a visit to a Kandian village, where we
can learn something of the mode of life and the ideas of the dwellers
in this jungle, and become acquainted with some of the animals who are
introduced into the stories which they relate.</p>
<p>We leave the dusty main roads, and follow a winding <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>village
path, never straight for a hundred yards except by accident&mdash;not
such a path as was constantly encountered thirty or more years ago, on
which the overhanging thorny bushes often made it necessary to bend low
or run the risk of having one&rsquo;s clothes torn, but a track flanked
with grass, having the bushes completely cleared away for a width of
twelve feet.</p>
<p>For a long distance we journey under an exhausting, pitiless, brazen
sun, which during all the middle part of the day the traveller feels
but never sees&mdash;never directing his gaze towards its blinding
glare. The heat is reflected from the unsheltered path. Shut out from
the cooling breath of the wind, we have on each side only closely
interlaced jungle, a tangled growth, consisting chiefly of leafy thorns
and creepers from ten to fifteen feet high, interspersed at varying
intervals with a few large trees. This is the wild growth that has
sprung up on the sites of abandoned ch&#275;nas or jungle clearings,
and will be cut down again for them from five to seven years
afterwards.</p>
<p>An occasional recent example of such a clearing may be passed,
having a few large surviving scorched trees, and several smaller ones,
interspersed among the growing crop of green millet. Round this a rough
fence made by laying sticks and blackened sapling trunks horizontally
between pairs of crooked posts&mdash;part of the unconsumed remains
after the cut and dried up bushes had been burnt&mdash;protects the
crop from the intrusion of deer and pigs and buffaloes.</p>
<p>Near the middle of the clearing, where two young trees grow in
proximity, two thin posts have been fixed in the ground, and between
these four supports a floor of sticks has been constructed at a height
of ten or twelve feet above the ground, reached by a rough stick ladder
with rungs two feet apart, and having a thatched roof overhead, and a
flimsy wall of sticks, interwoven with leafy twigs or grass on the
windward side. A thin floor of earth, watered and beaten until it
became hard, permits a small fire of sticks to be made in the shelter
if the nocturnal air be chilly. In this solitary watch-hut a man, or
sometimes two, sit or lie nightly, in order to drive away intruding
animals that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>may successfully evade or break through the
protecting fence, and feed on the crop.</p>
<p>In such clearings are cultivated chiefly millet of different sorts,
or edible grasses, sesame, and a small pulse called <i lang=
"si-latn">mun</i>; while in the richer soil around some scattered
conical brown anthills are planted maize, pumpkins, or red chillies,
and a few small cucumbers called <i lang="si-latn">kaekiri</i>, bearing
yellow or reddish fruit some six inches long. Climbing up two or three
of the smaller trees are to be seen gourds, with their curious,
hanging, pale, bottle-shaped fruit.</p>
<p>Along the path through the ch&#275;na jungle there are not many
signs of life. A Monitor Lizard or &ldquo;Iguana,&rdquo; about four
feet long, which we frighten as it was licking up ants and other
insects on the roadside with its extensile thin tongue, scurries off
quickly, and disappears down a hole in the side of an anthill. Over the
jungle come the slow monotonous calls, &ldquo;Tok, tok, tok,
tok,&rdquo; of a small Barbet, perched on the topmost twig of one of
the higher trees, jerking its body to the right and left as it repeats
its single note. A Woodpecker crosses the path with a screaming cry,
three times repeated, and a few other birds may appear at intervals,
but otherwise there is not much to break the sameness.</p>
<p>Then, if one be lucky, comes a tract of the original forest that has
escaped the ch&#275;na clearer&rsquo;s destructive bill-hook and fires,
in which is immediately experienced the welcome relief afforded by the
delightful cool shade cast by the forest trees of many species which
stretch high above the lower bushes. This is the home of the Elephant,
traces of which are observed in the wide footprints and an occasional
broken-down sapling or fractured branch. A slightly leaning tree on the
side of the path has tempted one to rub his back on it, and lower down
are the scratches left by a Leopard&rsquo;s claws, as he scraped them
on it like a cat.</p>
<p>As we pass along the leaf-strewn way, the loud hoarse cry,
&ldquo;H&#333;, h&#333;,&rdquo; of the large grey Monkeys (<i lang=
"la">Semnopithecus priamus</i>) whom we startle, resounds through the
trees. They cease to feed on the succulent young leaves, and shake the
rustling branches in their bold leaps among the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>higher ones.
This is soon followed by a sudden stillness as they mysteriously
conceal themselves, vanishing as though by magic among the denser
foliage.</p>
<p>Bird calls unfamiliar to a stranger are heard, especially the short
cry of two notes, rather than the crow, of the Jungle-cock&mdash;the
wild game-fowl of Ceylon,&mdash;the sheep-like bleats of the Lesser
Hornbill, sometimes the rich notes of the Crested Drongo, or the often
reiterated whistle, &ldquo;To meet ye&acute;-ou,&rdquo; of the
Whistling Babbler. A charming Ground Dove that was picking up seeds on
the path, flies off quickly down the path, and turns suddenly through
the bushes. A few white or brown or striped Butterflies, and sometimes
the lovely, large, dark velvety-green or steely blue Ornithoptera, flit
about. A few sharp notes, uttered as a small timid creature, little
bigger than a hare, darts off under the bushes, tell us that we have
startled a little Mouse-deer, <i lang="si-latn">M&#299;minn&#257;</i>.
These fragile-looking animals always stand on tiptoe, appearing
exactly, as Mr. R. A. Sterndale expressed it in his work, <span class=
"bibl"><i>The Mammalia of India</i></span>, &ldquo;as if a puff of wind
would blow them away.&rdquo; But as a rule, there is not much animal
life noticeable even in these forests, unless one can spare time to
search for it.</p>
<p>Another patch of the ch&#275;na jungle succeeds the forest, and then
the path reaches one end of the embankment of a village tank or
reservoir, a shallow sheet of water varying in size from two or three
acres to more than one hundred, but commonly from twenty to fifty in
area. The trim, earthen, grass-sloped embankment, nearly straight, from
an eighth of a mile to half a mile long, from nine to sixteen feet
high, and six feet wide on the top, rises a few feet above the water
level.</p>
<p>In its contrast with the parched and heated ground along which we
have come, the scene always appears strikingly beautiful. There are few
fairer spots on the earth than some of the village tanks when they are
nearly full of water. Here we may sit in the cool shelter of an
umbrageous tree, and contemplate nature in its most idyllic aspect. The
busy world, with its turmoil and stress, its noisy factories and
clanging machinery, its hurrying railway trains <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>and
motor-cars, its crowded cities full of an artificial and unhealthy
existence, has disappeared, as though it had been merely a fantastic
vision of the night. Here all is peace: an uneventful calm that has
survived the changes of perhaps two thousand years, and that may be
unaltered in another two thousand. One may wonder if the fevered life
of the present western civilisation will last as long, or will have
burnt itself out, and been swept away like that of the dead
civilisations that preceded it.</p>
<p>Abandoning these day dreams, which the seclusion of the site
induces, we look around us. At both sides of the tank and along the
outer toe of the embankment grow lofty trees, with grey trunks often
strengthened by wide buttresses, which are thrown out so as to afford
their support in the direction in which it is chiefly needed. If a
branch become unduly expanded on one side of the tree, always that on
which it receives the rays of the sun, so as to displace the centre of
gravity, the trunk at once proceeds to develop these thin triangular
buttresses under it, wide at the base, and extending ten or fifteen
feet upward. As though designed by an engineer, there are usually two
which act as struts, and support the trunk below the overweighted
branch; and on the opposite side a broader one which acts as a tie, and
assists in holding back the stem.</p>
<p>There is no lack of varied forms of animal life here. Often a party
of brown Monkeys who have come to drink at the tank are to be seen in
some of the trees, sitting quietly inspecting the visitors, or walking
leisurely along the branches, a few of the females carrying under their
bodies a young one tightly clutching them.</p>
<p>In many tanks, a low grey or dark-stained rock in the water affords
a favourite basking ground for the sluggish muddy-brown Crocodiles that
make their home in all but a few of the smallest of these tanks. They
lie on it like stranded logs, exposed to the sun&rsquo;s rays, often
with wide-open mouths, as though overcome by the heat, from which,
however, they make no effort to escape.</p>
<p>A few black Cormorants and a white Egret or two may <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>also be
there, resting on another part of the rock; and close to the water even
one or two little Black Tank Turtles, but not the edible White Tank
Turtle (<i lang="si-latn">Kiri-ibb&#257;</i>), which is much less
common. On a stump in the water is usually perched a Darter, a bird
that can outswim its fishy prey, with long snake-like neck, drying its
expanded wings under the fiery tropical rays. Its mate will be immersed
in the water, in which it swims with only its head and neck visible
above the surface.</p>
<p>Near the upper margin of the tank wades, with long deliberate
strides, a lanky Great White Egret (<i lang="la">Herodias alba</i>),
its neck outstretched in advance, and head held ready for a rapid
spear-like thrust of its long tapering bill at any frog or small fish
incautious enough to remain within its fatal reach. Nearer the edge of
the shallowest water Lesser Egrets step more hurriedly in search of
frogs, and often chase them as they rush spluttering along its
surface.</p>
<p>At the larger tanks the hoarse scream of a White-tailed Fishing
Eagle (<i lang="la">Polioaetus ichthyaetus</i>), perched on one of the
higher branches of a tall tree overhanging the water, resounds across
the open space, without frightening a flock of reddish-brown Whistling
Teal that float motionless near some lotus leaves, watching the human
intruders, who monopolise all their attention.</p>
<p>As we proceed along the embankment, we disturb some of the large
Frogs that were sunning themselves on it, or catching flies near the
edge of the water, and that plunge headlong into it with extended hind
legs.</p>
<p>We now perceive on the low side of the tank a stretch of fields, a
couple of hundred yards, a quarter of a mile, or half a mile long, or
even more, in which the clear uniform light green sheet of the paddy or
growing rice affords a pleasant relief after the uninteresting
ch&#275;na jungle. A long group of feathery-fronded Coconut trees near
the tank, fringing the far side of the field, indicates that we are
close to a Kandian village. The thatched grey roofs of some of the
houses are soon distinguishable below the palms, nearly concealed among
the plantain trees and other bushes growing about them. Above these
stand out several tall, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7"
name="pb7">7</a>]</span>deep green, pointed-leaved Mango trees, and
higher still a few wide-spreading Tamarinds and slender Halmilla
trees.</p>
<p>Before we reach them, our attention is again arrested by the
repeated mewing calls of the light-coloured Jacanas (<i lang=
"la">Hydrophasianus chirurgus</i>), with pheasant-like tails and
enormously lengthened toes, which distribute their weight over a wide
area. This enables them to walk on the round floating leaves of the
lotus plants that cover one portion of the tank, picking unwary insects
out of the water.</p>
<p>Near the side of the tank are to be seen the upper parts of the dark
heads of buffaloes, of which the bodies are immersed, as they lazily
chew the cud. A White Egret is perched on one whose back appears above
the water. At intervals a head disappears quietly below the surface,
and the dense crowd of small flies that had settled on it is driven to
flight, only to return once more as soon as it rises again.</p>
<p>In the shallower water near them, and nearly stationary, or moving a
few feet only at a time, stands a small silent Pond Heron (<i lang=
"la">Ardeola grayi</i>), avoiding observation as much as possible. Its
shoulders are raised, and its head is drawn down, so that it appears to
have no neck; its dorsal plumes spread over the closed wings and
completely hide them. When it stands still in this, its usual, attitude
it is almost unnoticeable among the aquatic weeds. On our approach it
flies off with a croak, transformed into a bird displaying broad white
wings and a long thin neck. It is far from being the voracious bird
that a well-known tale represents it to be.</p>
<p>A Chestnut Bittern (<i lang="la">Ardetta cinnamomea</i>), that had
stationed itself at the foot of the embankment, flits silently across
the water, and a Blue or Pied Kingfisher is seen poising itself with
down-turned bill, over a shoal of small fishes, on which it drops
unexpectedly with a sudden splash, and then wings its way to another
position where others have been detected.</p>
<p>On a patch of grass at the upper side of the tank we observe a
couple of white-necked Black Storks (<i lang="la">Ciconia
leucocephala</i>) promenading sedately in search of luckless frogs, but
maintaining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>a careful watch for human enemies who may be tempted
to endeavour to approach within gunshot.</p>
<p>Near this end of the embankment, a party of village women who have
brought their large, narrow-mouthed, brown earthen pots or
&ldquo;chatties&rdquo; for water, holding them on their hips by passing
an arm round the neck, will probably take to flight on seeing the white
strangers, or otherwise stand as far off the path as the space permits,
until they pass. A cry of rapidly shouted words is repeated through the
village, announcing the arrival of &ldquo;gentlemen,&rdquo; and soon
some of the men emerge, and after saluting us with hands raised to the
chest and palms touching each other, guide us into it.</p>
<p>On our way we pass by single houses or groups of two or three, built
in the midst of each little paddock, fifty or one hundred feet wide or
more, often with a very slight fence around it, of the scattered area
under the coconut palms which forms the gardens of the Kandian village.
Decently clad men and women come out of their mud-walled and often
whitewashed dwellings to stare at the strangers, as well as children of
all sizes, in varying stages of scanty clothing, from a short piece of
white calico which reaches from the waist to the ankles, down to its
vanishing point. The men wear a plain white cloth from the waist to the
ankles. The women have a white or coloured one about twelve feet long,
one end passing from the waist over the front of the figure, with the
corner thrown over the right shoulder, and hanging down behind as far
as the waist; the rest of the cloth is wrapped twice round the lower
part of the figure, from the waist downwards. When they visit other
villages many of the people of both sexes wear white jackets; in the
women&rsquo;s jackets the sleeves are gathered and puffed out at the
shoulder, and reach only to the elbow, and there is a wide, sometimes
frilled, double collar.</p>
<p>Our guides lead us on until we reach a dwelling possibly a little
more carefully constructed than the others, close to which is a
thatched, open, rectangular shed, about twelve feet long by nine feet
wide, with its roof resting on plain round wooden posts. Its raised
earthen floor is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>hastily swept, a heavy wooden mortar cut out of a
piece of tree trunk, and used for pounding rice in order to remove the
skin, is rolled away, and the shed is then ready for our temporary
occupation.</p>
<p>This is a <i lang="si-latn">ma&#7693;uwa</i>, or shed erected for
travellers and strangers, as well as for the general use of the owner,
in which the women may plait mats, or clean paddy or rice in the wooden
mortar, with a long wooden pestle having an iron ring round the lower
end. Here also the man&rsquo;s friends may sit and chat, and chew the
leaf of the Betel vine with broken-up bits of the nut of the Areka
Palm, and a little lime, and a fragment of tobacco leaf, while they
discuss the state of the crops, or the local news.</p>
<p>When such a shed is erected on the side of a path for public use, it
may have, but rarely, half walls four feet high; or the posts may be
tenoned into a rectangle of substantial squared logs that are halved
into each other at the angles, where they rest upon large stones, so as
to be clear of the ground, and thus partly protected from attacks by
white ants. The squared beams act as seats for the tired passer-by.</p>
<p>At the end of the ma&#7693;uwa in the village there is sometimes a
very small room of the same width, in which is stored millet or pulse
in bags, or ash-pumpkins, together with a few articles required about
the house, such as surplus grass mats, and flat winnowing baskets.
Under the roof of the ma&#7693;uwa, above the cross-beams and some
sticks laid on them, will be the owner&rsquo;s little plough, and board
for levelling the mud of the rice field before sowing, and some short
coils of rope made from the twisted inner bark of tough creepers, and
one or two fish creels.</p>
<p>When there is no suitable shed of this kind for the visitor, a hut,
usually one belonging to the village headman, is swept out and
temporarily given up to our use. If information of the coming visit had
been sent beforehand, the hut or shed would have been provided with a
ceiling made of lengths of white calico borrowed from the family
washerman, and perhaps the walls also would have been hung with others,
sometimes including such coloured ones as he had washed for some of the
villagers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p>While food is being prepared by our servants in a small shed or
kitchen close to the house, we stroll through the village, and observe
as we go that all the houses lie east and west, or north and south, and
are thatched with straw or plaited Coconut leaves. They are all
rectangular, usually eight or nine feet wide and some twelve feet long,
and are raised a couple of feet from the ground, on a solid earthen
foundation. Each one has a low <span class="corr" id="xd26e1158" title=
"Source: verandah">veranda</span>, two feet six inches or three feet
wide, along the front side, and one heavy door of adzed or sawn timber
near the middle; but there is very rarely a window, and even then only
one of the smallest size.</p>
<p>Near the end of the house, and within sight of the veranda, there
are one or two round corn stores, considerably wider at the top than at
the base, with conical thatched roofs. They rest upon cross sticks
placed upon four horizontal adzed logs, which are supported by four
small rough blocks of stone at the corners. Their walls are made of a
wicker frame hung from four or five durable posts set in the ground,
which are usually the heart wood of trees that are not eaten by white
ants. The upper part of the wicker frame is firmly tied to the tops of
these, and the whole wicker work is then thickly overlaid and stiffened
by successive coatings of mixed clay and sand, on which, as on all the
walls and floor of the dwelling house, there is placed a thin surface
wash of cow-dung.</p>
<p>These corn stores contain the household supply of paddy or millet.
They are entered only by raising the loose conical roof on one side by
a long prop, and getting inside by means of a rough ladder, at the
opening thus made, over the top of the wall, which rises eight or nine
feet above the ground. Sometimes, but rarely in the northern Kandian
districts, a small rectangular hut is used as a corn store, the
entrance in that case being made through a doorway in the middle of one
side.</p>
<p>The open ground along the front of the house is clean, and free from
grass and weeds, and is swept every morning. In this space, called the
<i lang="si-latn">mi&#7693;ula</i>, there is a stand of peeled sticks
supported on thin posts, and having a stick platform <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>about
four feet, or a little more, in length and two feet in width, raised
three feet from the ground, with often another similar platform below
it. On these are laid, after being washed, the blackened earthenware
cooking pots of the house, and spoons made of segments of coconut shell
with long wooden handles, which are used with them.</p>
<p>In the little kitchen at the end of the house, with a lean-to roof,
the hearths or fire-places called <i lang="si-latn">lipa</i> are formed
of three round stones fixed on the ground, about eight inches apart, on
which are set the cooking pots, over a fire of dry sticks. Sometimes a
separate small shed is built as a kitchen, but often the cooking is
done inside the single apartment of the house, at one end of it.</p>
<p>In each garden are a number of Coconut trees, some thin Halmilla
trees, and often a Mango tree, or a dark-leaved Jak tree, with its
enormous light green fruit hanging on pedicles from the trunk or larger
branches, as well as a Lime tree, and four or five clumps of Plantain
stems nearer the dwelling. Round the base of one or two of the Coconuts
or Halmilla trees are piled on end long bundles of firewood, nearly two
feet thick and six or eight feet long, the unconsumed sticks from the
ch&#275;na, collected by the women, tied round with creepers, and
carried home on their heads. Climbing up a small tree in front of the
house is a fine Betel vine, which is watered every day during the dry
weather. We notice that a bleached skull of a bull is fixed among the
leaves to guard the creeper from the unlucky glance of the &ldquo;Evil
Eye,&rdquo; which might cause its premature decay. In the damper ground
adjoining the rice field a few slender Areka palms are growing, with
their clusters of small fruit hanging below their leafy crowns.</p>
<p>On the outer side of the village, near the embankment of the tank,
there are the large, rough-stemmed Tamarind trees that we noticed as we
came. A number of separate thin posts are fixed in the bare ground
below them, to which are tethered a few small Buffalo calves, which
will be joined by their mothers at dusk, after their bath in the tank
is finished.</p>
<p>Further on, there is a small enclosure protected by a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>stick
fence, round which a few thorns are placed. At the entrance, the halves
of a split log, about nine inches wide, form gate posts; and five
moveable horizontal bars pass easily through holes cut through them, a
few loose thorns being rolled against them when the enclosure is shut
up at night. This is a cattle-fold, or <i lang="si-latn">g&#257;la</i>,
into which the little harmless black humped cattle are driven each
evening by some boys, with the repeated long-drawn cry, <i lang=
"si-latn">G&#257;l&#275;</i>, &ldquo;Into the fold.&rdquo; In some
districts tobacco or chillies will be planted on this well-manured plot
of ground in the following spring, a new cattle fold being then
made.</p>
<p>On our return to the shed we see that our host&rsquo;s wife has
cooked his evening meal of boiled rice and vegetable curry, with a bit
of sun-dried fish as a flavouring, these last being often made burning
hot with red chillies. She serves it in the raised veranda to him and a
relative who has come from a distant village, after giving them water
for rinsing out their mouths. Both sit or &ldquo;squat&rdquo; on their
heels, and convey the food to their mouths with their right hands, out
of the shallow, rather wide basins that act as plates. Where the supply
of such household articles runs short, leaf plates made of a piece of
plantain leaf, or two or three halmilla leaves pinned together, are
used. When they have finished the meal, and have rinsed their right
hands and drunk water&mdash;which is never taken while eating&mdash;and
have been served with a chew of betel leaf and its accompaniments, the
wife eats the remains of the meal alone, inside the house. If she and
her husband were alone they would take it together, the husband being
first served.</p>
<p>The men now sit on mats spread in the narrow veranda, where a little
oil lamp is perhaps hung, and the woman, after throwing out the remains
of the food for the dog, and washing the basins and cooking utensils,
and arranging them on their stand, joins the party, and shares in the
evening&rsquo;s conversation. Sometimes, however, she finds it
necessary to pound some paddy until bed-time, in order to remove the
husk, in readiness for the meals of the following day; or millet or
rice may require grinding into flour in the stone quern. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span></p>
<p>If some intimate village friends were there, this would be the time
when, after discussing the events of the day, or making arrangements
for the morrow, a member of the party might finish the evening&rsquo;s
chat by relating one of the familiar old stories of which translations
appear in this book.</p>
<p>In the end the woman retires, the visitor stretches himself on his
grass mat in the veranda, and the host extinguishes the lamp, if one
had been lit, and enters the single room of his house. On the next
night it will be his turn to occupy the watch-hut at the chena, where
his partner is sitting now.</p>
<p>All take care to lie, if possible, in an east and west direction,
and on no account with their heads to the south. This is the abode of
Yama, the god of death, while the north is the quarter inhabited by
demons. These directions are therefore exposed to evil influences which
might affect the sleeper, and perhaps cause such unlucky omens as evil
dreams.</p>
<p>The dog curls himself on the ground at the front of the house, the
cat wanders off to join some village cronies, and all is silent in the
village, except the rustling of the Coconut fronds overhead, the
monotonous call, &ldquo;Wuk; chok-ch&#335;-tok,&rdquo; uttered by a
small owl in one of the higher trees, and the more distant chorus of
the frogs in the adjoining rice field.</p>
<p>Now and again we hear at some villages the long-drawn, human-like
cry, &ldquo;H&#333;&#333;, h&#333;&#333;, h&#333;&#333;,&rdquo; of a
large Wood-Owl (<i lang="la">Syrnium indranee</i>), that is flying
round high in the air, and answering its distant mate. It is a weird
unearthly sound, which is always firmly believed by the villagers to be
uttered by demons, as will be noticed in some of the stories.</p>
<p>The earliest cry of the morning is the deep booming note, three or
four times repeated, of the large Ground Cuckoo (<i lang=
"la">Centrococcyx rufipennis</i>), which is heard soon after dawn
appears. Our host&rsquo;s wife is at work before daylight, scraping
into shreds the kernel of a half coconut, and preparing some
milk-rice&mdash;rice boiled in milk made by squeezing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>grated
coconut in water until the latter assumes the colour of milk.</p>
<p>By sun-rise, the Crows of the village are astir, and the Parrakeets,
commonly called &ldquo;Parrots&rdquo; in the East, which have been
sleeping in the coconut trees, fly away in parties in search of
food.</p>
<p>The notes of the double kettle-drum at a neighbouring <i lang=
"si-latn">wih&#257;ra</i>, or Buddhist temple, consisting of three
deep-toned strokes at short intervals, followed by five rapid blows on
a higher key, once repeated, the whole series being many times sounded,
now announce to the villagers within hearing that this is one of the
four P&#333;ya days of the month, the Buddhist Sabbath, kept at each of
the quarters of the moon.</p>
<p>About an hour later, our host&rsquo;s wife is joined by a party of
eight or ten women, and one or two men, all dressed in clean white
clothes. They proceed to the temple, each carrying in a small bowl a
present of milk-rice and a few cakes, covered with a white cloth. There
they chant three times, after the resident monk, the Buddhist creed,
&ldquo;I go to the Buddha-refuge, I go to the Faith-refuge, I go to the
Community (of Monks)-refuge&rdquo;; this is followed by some more
stanzas in the ancient language, P&#257;li, after which they return,
and resume the ordinary occupations of the day.</p>
<p>Our host is about to leave his room after his night&rsquo;s rest,
when the chirp of a little pale-coloured House Lizard on the wall
causes him to turn back suddenly, in order to avoid the evil influences
against which the wise Lizard had uttered its warning voice. He
occupies himself in the house for a short time longer, and then, at a
luckier moment, makes his appearance afresh, taking care to step over
the threshold with the right foot first.</p>
<p>He is cheered by finding that nothing obstructs his way in the least
after he comes out, and that we are the first living beings on which
his gaze rests. To begin the day by seeing first a person of superior
status is a lucky omen of the favourable character of the rest of the
day, and one with which he is not often blessed. We increase the
auspicious impression by a few judicious friendly remarks; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>but are
careful not to offer any decided praise regarding any of his
possessions, since we are aware of his opinion that one never knows if
such sayings may not have a reverse effect through the malevolence of
jealous evil spirits. There is an Evil Mouth, as well as an Evil
Eye.</p>
<p>A man or two, and a few boys, come from the adjoining houses to
watch our doings, from the open space in front of the house, or the
veranda; but all turn their faces away and ignore us from the moment
when we sit down to our &ldquo;early tea,&rdquo; and until it is
finished. This is done so as to avoid any risk of our food&rsquo;s
affecting us injuriously, owing to a possible glance of the Evil Eye,
which a person may possess without being aware of the fact.</p>
<p>We notice a little copper tube slung on the right upper arm of our
host&rsquo;s wife, by means of a yellow thread which passes through two
rings on its under side. In reply to our carefully worded inquiry
regarding it, he informs us that as she had been troubled with evil
dreams they had thought it advisable to get a friend of his, a
Vedar&#257;la or doctor, who was acquainted with astrological and
magical lore, to supply her with a magical diagram and spell against
dreams, inscribed on a strip of dried palm leaf, which was rolled up
and placed in the tube. The thread, a triple one, was coloured with
saffron, and nine knots were made on it before it was tied on her arm,
a magical spell being repeated as each knot was made. Thanks to this
safeguard the dreams had ceased, but it was considered advisable not to
remove the thread and charm for a few weeks longer.</p>
<p>Our host&rsquo;s relative, having eaten some milk-rice, and taken a
chew of betel and areka-nut in his mouth, is about to return to his
distant village, and now leaves, saying only, &ldquo;Well, I am
going.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is good; having gone come,&rdquo; is the reply.
The latter word must not be omitted, or it might appear that his return
in the future was not desired.</p>
<p>So he sets off on his journey, the host accompanying him to the
garden fence. However, in a few minutes he is back again, and explains
that he had met with a bad omen which made it necessary to postpone the
departure. A dog stood in the path, obstructing his way, and made
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>no attempt to move even when he spoke to it. The
host cordially agrees that it would be most unwise to continue the
journey after such an unfavourable omen on starting, and it is settled
that he will leave early in the afternoon, when the danger, whatever it
may be, probably will have passed away.</p>
<p>And so on, like a perpetual nightmare haunting him during his whole
journey through life, the Kandian villager sees his dreaded portents in
the simplest occurrences of his daily life. A few are prognostications
of good luck; but far more in number are those which are to him obvious
warnings, not to be disregarded with impunity, of some unknown but
impending evil that he must avoid if possible.</p>
<p>Every evil is directly due to evil spirits, either specially
instigated to injure him by inimical magicians, or taking advantage of
some accidental opportunity. The evil spirits are innumerable and
malevolent, and ever ready to make use of any chance to annoy or injure
human beings. Thus it would be the height of foolhardiness to ignore
events that appear to be signs of some approaching unfavourable action
on their part.</p>
<p>One man informed me that in the dusk one evening he was unable to
find the little exit path from his chena, and was compelled to remain
all night there before the clearing work was finished. He attributed
this entirely to the malicious action of an evil spirit, who had
blocked it up in order to annoy him. When daylight came the path was
clear, and so plainly to be seen that he was certain that he could not
have missed it at night had it been in a similar state at that
time.</p>
<p>I knew of one instance in which a man who had arranged to make a
lengthy trading journey, and had loaded his cart with produce ready for
an early start at daybreak, abandoned the trip because he had a dream
in the night which he considered indicated an unfavourable prospect.
The reader will find a similar tale included among these stories; and
although the villagers laugh at the foolish men of whom it is related,
there are scores of others who would return home under such
circumstances. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is a holiday season for the villagers, during which they can
devote themselves to the congenial occupation of contemplating the
growth of the rice and the millet crop; but it was preceded by much
hard work in the rice field and the chena. The felling of the thorny
jungle at the chena, the lopping and burning of the bushes, the
clearing and hoeing of the ground, and the construction of the
surrounding fence, were carried on continuously under a scorching sun
from morning to night, until the work was completed shortly before the
first light showers enabled the seed to be sown, after a further
clearing of the weeds that had sprung up over the ground.</p>
<p>As soon as the heavier rains had softened the hard soil of the rice
field, baked, where not sandy, by the tropical sun until it became like
stone, the work of ploughing and preparing the land for the paddy crop
was one that permitted little or no intermission. Every morning the men
carried their little ploughs on their shoulders, and yoking a couple of
buffaloes to each of them, spent many hours in guiding the blunt plough
backwards and forwards through the soil, overgrown since the last crop
by a covering of grass. It requires no slight labour to convert such an
apparently intractable material into a smooth sheet of soft mud, eight
inches deep. After that is done, all the little earthen ridges that
form the raised borders of each of the rectangular plots into which the
field is divided, and that are necessary for retaining the sheet of
water which is periodically flooded over the rice, must be repaired and
trimmed.</p>
<p>When that is accomplished the ground must be sown by hand without
delay, with paddy which has already sprouted, and being merely
scattered lightly on the surface of the thick mud, will grow at once.
The preparation of the paddy for this purpose is one of the duties of
the women, who soak it in water, and spread it a few inches thick on
large mats laid on the floor of the shed or the veranda. In three days
it will be sprouted, and ready for immediate sowing. After the sowing
is completed, there still remains the repair or reconstruction of the
stick fence which protects the field from cattle, or, in some parts,
deer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is thought to be essential for obtaining a satisfactory crop,
that each of the more important operations of these or any other works
should be commenced on a day and at an hour that have been selected by
the local astrologer as auspicious. There must be no unfavourable
aspects of the planets, which are held to have a most powerful and
often deleterious influence on all terrestrial matters; planets or no
planets, certain days are also recognised by every person who claims a
modicum of intelligence, as being notoriously unlucky.</p>
<p>After the time for beginning the ploughing, or commencing the
clearing of the jungle at the chena, has been so chosen, a start must
be made at that hour, even though it be nothing more than a beginning;
and usually the plough is once run at that time through each little
plot of the field, several days before the real ploughing is
undertaken. In the case of the chena, a few branches will be lopped off
at the lucky moment, and the remainder of the work can then be done
when convenient.</p>
<p>Without such necessary precautions no village cultivator would be
astonished at the subsequent failure or unproductiveness of the crops,
either through excess or deficiency of the rainfall, or damage caused
by wild animals, or, in the case of the rice, by an excessive irruption
of &ldquo;flies&rdquo; or bugs, which suck out the milky juices of the
immature grains. The surprise would be felt, not at the failure of the
crops under such unfavourable conditions, but at the survival of any
crop worth reaping.</p>
<p>Of course, in the case of the &ldquo;flies&rdquo; on the rice the
usual remedy of their forefathers will be tried. A Bali Tiyann&#257;, a
priest who makes offerings to arrest or avert the evil influences due
to unpropitious planets, will be summoned. After presenting a small
offering, he will march round the crop, blowing a perforated chank
shell in order to alarm any unfavourable spirits; at each side of the
field he will formally exorcise the flies, and in a loud voice order
them to depart.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1268src" href="#xd26e1268"
name="xd26e1268src">1</a></p>
<p>But on the whole, notwithstanding the thorough confidence
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>of the exorcist in the efficacy of this treatment,
it is felt to be a last resort, which ought to be, but often is not,
altogether as successful as the owner of the crop might desire. Planets
and flies are sometimes intractable, and will not hearken to the
charmer. Besides, thinks the cultivator, who knows if the Bali
Tiyann&#257; was so foolish as to speak to some one on his march round
the field, and thus break the spell?</p>
<p>Now that he comes to consider the matter, the cultivator remembers
that he heard the cry of a Woodpecker<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1277src" href="#xd26e1277" name="xd26e1277src">2</a> as he was
leaving the house for the first ploughing. He thought at the time that,
as the hour had been declared to be a fortunate one, that warning
scream was intended for some other person; but now he is of opinion
that it may have been addressed to him. It is unfortunate; it must have
been settled by Fate that he should neglect it, but he will exercise
more care another time. He feels that he can always place confidence in
the House Lizards and Woodpeckers, because they receive their
information from the gods themselves.</p>
<p>When the chena crop is ripe, the wives of the owners collect a
number of friends and relatives, and proceed with them to the place,
each carrying a light sack or two, and a diminutive sickle. With this
they cut off the heads of the millet, storing them in the sacks; the
straw is left as useless. All the party are rather gaily dressed,
usually in white, and often have a broad strip of calico tied over the
head, with the ends falling down the back. This work is looked upon as
a recreation, and is carried on amid a large amount of chatter and
banter, and the singing of songs by first one and then another, each
verse being repeated by the whole party. Some that are sung are simple
verses from the olden time, which probably are believed to have a
magical influence.</p>
<p>At noon and in the evening the bags full of millet are carried to
the houses of the owners of the crop. Meals are provided for the whole
party by them, and no payment is made for the work. In most districts
the men never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>take any part in this reaping, and their presence
would be thought objectionable. As one of them expressed it, they stay
at home and boil water.</p>
<p>For the reaping of the rice crop, the man to whom it belongs
collects a few assistants in the same way, the women also sometimes
joining in the work. The stems of the plants are cut near the ground,
and are tied up in little sheaves, which are collected first at some of
the junctions of the earthen ridges in the field. The whole are removed
afterwards and built into larger stacks at the side of the field, near
a flat threshing-floor of hard earth, surrounded by a fence in which a
few trees are planted as a shade.</p>
<p>The threshing of the stacks is a business of great importance, which
must be performed according to ancient customs that are supposed to
have a magical effect, and prevent injurious demoniacal interference
with the out-turn. After the floor has been thoroughly cleaned and
purified, a magical circular diagram, with mystical symbols round it,
is drawn on the ground round a central post, before the threshing can
be commenced.</p>
<p>The unthreshed rice is laid over the floor in a circle round the
central post, and four buffaloes in a row are driven over it, round and
round the post, following the direction taken by the sun, that is, from
the east towards the south and so on through the circle, the stems of
the rice being shaken up from time to time. After the corn has been
thus trampled out of the ears it is collected and poured gradually out
of baskets held high in the air, so that the wind may blow away the
chaff. The corn is then placed in sacks and carried to the store.</p>
<p>After the crop of the chena or field has been gathered in, a small
offering of the first-fruits is made at the local D&#275;w&#257;la, or
demon temple, and cleaned rice is also presented to the resident monk
at the local Buddhist temple.</p>
<p>When the crop is placed in the store, the household supply of food
for at least a great part of the year, and commonly for the whole year,
has been provided for. Such additions as salt, sun-dried fish, and some
of the condiments <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21"
name="pb21">21</a>]</span>used in curries are obtained by bartering
coconuts, or paddy, or millet, at little roadside shops which are
established at a few places along the main roads throughout the
country. These are kept by Muhammadan trades&mdash;commonly termed
Tambi, with, in village talk, the honorific addition <i lang=
"si-latn">ayiy&#257;</i>, &ldquo;elder brother,&rdquo;&mdash;or
Sinhalese from the Low Country districts, or Tamils from Jaffna; and
rarely or never by Kandians. From these shops, also, clothes are
procured at long intervals in the same way, or a special journey is
made to the nearest town or larger shopping centre.</p>
<p>As a general rule, in the interior it is all a matter of barter, and
very little money is used, so little indeed that if the crops be less
satisfactory than usual the villager often has difficulty in paying the
tax of a rupee and a half (two shillings), which is collected by
Government each year from adult males, towards the cost of keeping the
roads in order. In the poorer districts, the payment of this, the only
direct tax of the villager, is like a recurring annual nightmare, which
worries him for weeks together, and unfortunately cannot be charmed
away, like his other nightmares, by a magic thread.</p>
<p>Village life is on the whole a dull one. Its excitements are
provided by demon-ceremonies for the cure of sickness, occasional
law-suits, and more especially by weddings, which afford a welcome
opportunity for feasting, and displaying clothes and jewellery, but
sometimes also cause quarrels owing to caste or family jealousies. It
would be too long a digression to attempt to describe these here.
Pilgrimages to important Buddhist temples are also undertaken, about
nine-tenths of the pilgrims being women, a proportion sometimes
observable in church attendance in England.</p>
<p>One of the pleasantest features of village life is the family
re-union at the Sinhalese New Year, April 11 or 12, when all the
members meet at their old home if possible, and make little presents to
each other, and pay ceremonial visits, dressed in their best clothes,
to their relatives and friends. The men also call on their local
headmen, who in the same way visit their superiors. I have known
considerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>numbers of villagers tramp ninety miles on hot
dusty roads, with an equally long return journey in prospect, in order
to be present at this home gathering.</p>
<p>For three weeks before the day, the whole village life is
disorganised by preparations for this festival. The houses are
furbished up, plantains and palm sugar are collected, often from places
many miles away, new clothes are purchased, and every one&rsquo;s mind
is given up to anticipation of the event and provision for it, to the
complete exclusion of all ordinary work. It is also a busy time for
astrologers, who are required to fix a suitable day and a lucky hour
for the first lighting of the New Year&rsquo;s fire, the first cooking
of food, and, three or four days later, the hour at which the heads of
all shall be anointed, pending which important ceremony no work is
begun or journey commenced.</p>
<p>In many villages the women produce from some dark hiding-place the
little board with fourteen little cup-shaped hollows, in two rows each
consisting of seven cups, on which the ancient game called in Ceylon
&ldquo;Olinda&rdquo; is played. Four bright red seeds of the Olinda
creeper are placed in each cup, and the two players, who sit on
opposite sides of the board, &ldquo;sow&rdquo; them one by one in the
holes. As a rule, only the women play at this game, at which many of
them are adepts, carrying it on for hours at a time with the greatest
rapidity and skill. At the conclusion of the New Year&rsquo;s holiday,
or soon after it, the boards are returned to their hiding-places, and
often are not used again for another year. In the villages where Low
Country influence has penetrated, many of the men find gambling a more
attractive amusement, as well as a more exciting one, at this time.</p>
<p>About once in a couple of years a party of Gypsies who speak Telugu,
and broken Tamil and Sinhalese, come along the high road, and settle
down on a patch of open grass near a tank. The talipat palm leaves with
which their diminutive oblong huts are roofed, and strong creepers or
bamboos curved in a semicircle, for making the skeleton framework, are
transported on small donkeys, the women and children carrying the other
few household goods and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=
"#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>cooking utensils in bundles on their
heads. Some take about with them large numbers of goats.</p>
<p>As soon as they have raised their little huts, each about four feet
high, and surrounded by a shallow channel for carrying off rain water,
the adults leave them in charge of the children and old women, and
spread through all the villages of the neighbourhood in order to
collect food or money. The man carries in a round, flat, black basket
slung in a cloth from his shoulder, a cobra or two, which are made to
&ldquo;dance,&rdquo; a term which means merely sitting coiled up (the
head with the hood expanded being raised about fifteen inches from the
ground), and making attempts to strike the moving knee or hand of the
crouching exhibitor. The women tell fortunes by the lines on the
hands.</p>
<p>All the village girls endeavour to raise the requisite three
halfpence or twopence so as to hear, often for the third or fourth
time, of their past and future experiences, and to be promised handsome
husbands possessing fields and cattle. The adults pay a little rice for
the exhibition of the cobras.</p>
<p>When the Gypsies have exhausted the contributory possibilities of
the adjoining villages they move on again to another camping ground.
They have always a number of dogs which assist in catching animals for
the food supply, and it is few, whether provided with legs or without
legs, that are thought unfit to eat. The diet includes white ants,
rat-snakes, owls, and munguses, as well as any stray village fowls that
can be acquired surreptitiously.</p>
<p>These Gypsies of Ceylon are an interesting race, and I may be
permitted a digression in order to furnish some details regarding them.
I am not aware how long they have settled in Ceylon; they are permanent
dwellers in the island, and are especially found in the northern half
and the eastern districts, but also in the south and in the hill
districts. In the Sinhalese districts they have developed a dialect
which appears to be a curious compound of Telugu and Sinhalese. Thus
fowls, which in Telugu are termed <i lang="te-latn">K&#333;llu</i>, are
known by them as <i>Guglu</i>, the Sinhalese <i lang=
"si-latn">Kukul&#803;u</i>.</p>
<p>From a Gypsy with whom, by the aid of pecuniary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>intervention, I established friendly relations,
cemented by my presenting him one day with a fine newly-caught cobra, I
learnt that they enjoy general good health, notwithstanding the
apparent hardships of their life. They attribute this to their constant
changes of drinking-water and camping-sites, no camp being maintained
in one place for more than seven days in the Sinhalese districts. In
the Eastern Province, where the Gypsies possess very large herds of
cattle, amounting sometimes to four or five hundred, they camp in one
spot for a month if the grazing be sufficiently good.</p>
<p>They do not keep their cobras for more than a month. After being
kept for that period, they not only become too tame to
&ldquo;dance,&rdquo; but, what is far more important, their poison
fangs grow afresh, and it would be dangerous to retain them. They are
therefore always released at the end of that time, if not earlier. They
are fed regularly upon fowls&rsquo; eggs and occasional rats.</p>
<p>My friend characterised as nonsense the idea of their handling and
using cobras which have not had their fangs excised. The reader may
remember Sir Bartle Frere&rsquo;s note in <span class="bibl"><i>Old
Deccan Days</i></span>, p. 329, regarding a boy who continued to handle
with impunity poisonous snakes with unremoved fangs, until at last one
killed him. The reader is also referred to <span class="bibl">Drummond
Hay&rsquo;s <i>Western Barbary</i>, 1844, pp. 105&ndash;108</span>, in
which an account is given of a snake-charmer who allowed a deadly snake
to bite him. A fowl that it bit immediately afterwards died in a
minute, while the man did not suffer from the bite. Hay saw the
snake&rsquo;s fangs. He mentions another instance at Tangier, in which
a youth who was sceptical regarding the poison allowed the snake to
bite him, and died from the effect of it.</p>
<p>I saw this Gypsy cut off the fangs of the cobra that I gave him.
This was done with a common pen-knife which he kept for the purpose.
The head being held sideways on a thick stick, so that the upper jaw
lay on it, the fang was cut off at the base. The head was then turned,
and the other fang removed. The man then passed his fore-finger along
the jaw, and finding a slight roughness or projection, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>sliced
off a little of the bone at each side. After this he released the
cobra, which followed him and sprang at him furiously, time after time,
and had its first lesson on the ease with which he evaded its strokes.
When it became tired of attempting the impossible, he consigned it to
his basket&mdash;another cobra ready for exhibition.</p>
<p>Some of these men are extraordinarily expert in making pretended
captures of cobras which they apparently fascinate by their pipes, so
as to attract them from their holes or hiding-places. They perform this
feat so cleverly as to deceive many people, who insist that it is a
real capture. I have twice got them to do it for me&mdash;in the
Southern and the North-western Provinces&mdash;and although I watched
them from a very short distance, I was unable to see whence the cobra
was produced. On both occasions I examined the mouth of the cobra
immediately after it was captured, and in both instances I found that
the fangs had been removed. My Gypsy friend also assured me that it was
a mere trick which only a few learn.</p>
<p>In each case, the man, who was dressed only in a cloth extending
from the waist to the calf, after piping for some time at the edge of
the bushes in which the snake might possibly be found, bent down
suddenly, half entering the bush, and apparently endeavoured to seize a
cobra which eluded him. After resuming the piping for a few seconds
more, he bent down again at the same spot, and drew out a large
cobra&mdash;one was nearly six feet long; it extended to the full
length of his outstretched hands&mdash;holding it by the tail; then
slipping his other hand rapidly along its body he grasped it tightly
behind the jaws. Probably when first bending down he placed a cobra on
the ground, afterwards seizing it by the tail as it was moving off.</p>
<p>In one case, a pretence at being bitten on the thumb on the way back
from the bush was very effective. There were two bleeding punctures
between the nail and the knuckle, at the right distance apart, and the
expressions of pain no doubt were not altogether simulated.</p>
<p>The supposed poison was extracted by means of the usual spells and
remedial agents&mdash;a charmed piece of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>creeper and a tiny ball
of lime, the latter to check the progress of the poison along the arm,
and the former to draw it down to the wounds; and two &ldquo;snake
stones&rdquo;&mdash;nearly flat rectangular pieces of horn slightly
hollowed on one side&mdash;which were placed on the wounds to extract
the poison. These &ldquo;stones&rdquo; adhere by atmospheric pressure
when wetted and pressed on the skin with the hollowed side downwards. I
have been informed that the wounds are made by pressing on the thumb a
thorny seed capsule which has two sharp spikes at a suitable distance
apart.</p>
<p>One of these men afterwards proceeded to a large village about a
mile away, and appeared to capture three more cobras in the same manner
at houses where the residents denied that any were to be found; but in
the end I was told by the villagers that he had only two cobras in his
basket, this being the number that I saw in his possession before these
last pretended captures were made.</p>
<p>These people are said to live well, better, indeed, than the
majority of the villagers. The women are given to lavish personal
adornment of an inexpensive kind, chiefly articles of brass and glass.
On one lady, perhaps considered a beauty, I counted sixteen bead
necklaces; twenty-four bangles, chiefly of common black glass, on the
wrists; four silver armlets on the upper arms; and six rings on each
finger and thumb, excepting only the middle finger of each hand.</p>
<p>The Kandian village is a self-contained unit, producing everything
that the inhabitants require, with the exception of the few articles
previously mentioned. It hears a faint echo of the news of the great
outer world, without feeling that this has any connexion with its own
life. It would listen with almost equal indifference to a statement
that the sky was blue, or that England was at war with a European
power, or that a new Governor had been appointed. When I asked a
villager&rsquo;s opinion regarding the transfer of a Government Agent
who had ruled a Province for some years, he replied, &ldquo;They say
one Agent has gone and another Agent has come; that is all.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>The supervision of the work of maintaining in order the embankment
of the village reservoir or &ldquo;tank,&rdquo; upon which the rice
crops depend, as well as of the fencing of the rice field, is in the
hands of the Gamar&#257;la, now termed in other parts than the
North-central Province, the Vid&#257;n&#275;. The latter title is not
recognised in any of the folk-tales, in which (with one exception) the
Gamar&#257;la is the only headman represented. His jurisdiction extends
over two or three closely adjoining villages, or sometimes over one
only.</p>
<p>Of a higher rank and different functions is the &#256;racci
(pronounced &#256;ratchy), who rules over five or six villages, and who
is responsible for the maintenance of order, arrests and prosecutes
offenders, and acts as general factotum for seeing that the orders
received from superior headmen are promulgated and obeyed.</p>
<p>Of much more important authority are the
K&#333;ral&#275;-&#256;racci and K&#333;r&#257;la, the latter being the
head of a considerable district, and above these again is the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1382" title=
"Source: Rat&#275;mahatmay&#257;">Ra&#7789;&#275;mahatmay&#257;</span>,
who is the supreme and very influential chief of a large part of a
Province. By successive steps in promotion the members of influential
or respectable families may rise to any of these offices. Though all
but the highest one are unsalaried, they are competed for with a good
deal of eagerness on account of the power which they confer, the
possibility of further promotion, and also for the opportunities which
they afford for receiving &ldquo;presents,&rdquo; which flow in a
pleasing though invisible, but not therefore less remunerative, stream
towards all but the Vid&#257;n&#275;s and Gamar&#257;las.</p>
<p>A few words may be added regarding the castes of the Kandian
districts whose stories are given in this work, or who are referred
to.</p>
<p>The Smiths come next to the cultivating caste, sometimes occupying
separate hamlets, but often living in the same village as the superior
caste, though divided from it by an impassable gulf, of which only the
women preserve the outward sign. Those of the cultivating caste are
alone permitted by social custom to dress in one outer robe in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>one piece; all of lower rank must wear a separate
garment from the waist upward.</p>
<p>The Smiths are considered to be the highest class of their caste,
called <i lang="si-latn">Nayid&#275;</i>, the artificers. There are
said to be five classes of Nayid&#275;s:&mdash;(1) <i lang=
"si-latn">&#256;c&#257;ri</i> (pronounced &#256;tch&#257;ry), which
includes the Smiths, Painters, and Sculptors; (2) <i lang=
"si-latn">Ba&#7693;ahaela</i>, Potters; (3) <i lang=
"si-latn">Mukkara</i> or <i lang="si-latn">Kar&#257;wa</i>, Fishers;
(4) <i lang="si-latn">Madinna</i>, Toddy-drawers (&ldquo;toddy&rdquo;
is fresh palm-juice); (5) all &ldquo;Moormen,&rdquo; the descendants of
Muhammadan settlers. All these, and the other low castes, except the
Ro&#7693;iy&#257;s, cultivate rice and millet.</p>
<p>The Potters live by making all local forms of earthen pottery, and
tiles and bricks if required. They build up large temporary kilns
filled with alternate layers of pots and fire-wood, and are often
intelligent men. Some of them are priests or conductors of services for
the propitiation of planets and other evil astronomical bodies, as well
as astrologers.</p>
<p>Next in the villages come the Washermen (<i lang=
"si-latn">Radaw&#257;</i>, or <i lang="si-latn">H&#275;nay&#257;</i>,
or <i lang="si-latn">H&#275;nawalay&#257;</i>), who possess great power
as the arbiters regarding cases of the violation of social etiquette or
custom. The disgrace of a refusal on their part to wash the clothes of
objectionable persons is a form of social ostracism, and the offender
soon has sad experience of the truth of the statement of the Mah&#257;
Bh&#257;rata that there is nothing (except fire) that is so purifying
as gold (or its value). Some of the washermen are officiators at demon
ceremonies. They are paid for their services as washermen in produce of
various kinds, each family giving an annual subvention in paddy, etc.,
in return for its washing. One whom I knew could improvise four-line
stanzas for an indefinite time, on the spur of the moment, each verse
being composed while the audience chanted the refrain after the
preceding one.</p>
<p>The Tom-tom Beaters (<i lang="si-latn">Beraway&#257;</i>) are a
peculiar and interesting caste, who formerly combined their present
duties with the weaving of cotton fabrics in frames. Although the
arduous work of their profession&mdash;often a whole night&rsquo;s hard
dancing or tom-toming&mdash;leads at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>time to a considerable
consumption of &ldquo;arrack,&rdquo; the spirit distilled from palm
juice, I believe that few of them take much liquor at other times.</p>
<p>In their own work many of them are very expert, the result of many
years of training. On one occasion three tom-tom beaters requested
permission to give me an exhibition of their skill. The leader first
played a short simple tune, which was repeated in turn by the second
and third players. They continued to play in this way, in turn, the
tunes becoming increasingly difficult and rapid; whatever impromptu
changes the leader introduced were all repeated in the same manner by
the others. A number of villagers who were present, and listening
critically, stated that it was a clever performance; it was also a
noisy one.</p>
<p>The boys are taught to learn thoroughly, without using a tom-tom,
the whole of the complicated airs that are played, repeating a series
of sounds such as <i>ting</i>, <i>tang</i>, etc., which with varying
emphasis represent the various notes to be played on the tom-tom. Not
until they can give in this manner the whole of an air correctly, as
regards notes, time, and emphasis, are they considered to know it. It
is a tonic sol-fa system. To these professionals, every air has its
name and meaning, often expressed in words which fit the notes; so that
when a very few notes have been heard they can state what is being
said. The reader will find one or two references to this in the
folk-tales.</p>
<p>The <i>Duray&#257;s</i> are the carriers of baggage for the higher
caste, and nearly always have tanks and fields of more than average
quality. These have been granted to them in former times by the
cultivating caste in return for their services, which could be claimed
at any time if a man were about to proceed on a journey, and required
himself or his luggage carrying. They still occupy a very low social
position. Formerly the women were not allowed to wear above the waist
more clothing than a strip of calico of about a hand&rsquo;s breadth,
across the breast; a coloured handkerchief now generally takes its
place.</p>
<p>Much has been written about the <i lang=
"si-latn">Ro&#7693;iy&#257;s</i>. They may be of partly different
descent from the Sinhalese, but I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30"
href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>do not know how far this matter
has been investigated. Their hamlets are never called <i lang=
"si-latn">gama</i>, &ldquo;village,&rdquo; but <i lang=
"ta-latn">kupp&#257;yama</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1461src" href=
"#xd26e1461" name="xd26e1461src">3</a> I am not aware that any of them
cultivate rice fields; they make ropes, and guard chenas and cattle for
others. They also partly subsist by begging, and, it is said, by theft;
some are gamblers also. The women usually wear no clothing above the
waist. Their dialect differs from Sinhalese to some extent.</p>
<p>Nothing is known regarding the origin of the <i lang=
"si-latn">Kinnar&#257;s</i>, the lowest caste of all, in whose case
there are several anomalies that deserve investigation. They do not
hunt as a profession. They have village tanks and rice fields, own
cattle, and have good houses and neat villages. Their caste occupation
is mat weaving in frames, with Niyanda fibre alone or combined with
grass.</p>
<p>Some have their heads covered with a mass of thick, short, very
curly hair, being the only people in the island possessing this
distinctive characteristic. The features and the colour of the skin are
of the ordinary type of the lower castes, and would not enable them to
be recognised from others. Social rules forbid the growth of the hair
beyond the neck. The dress of the women is restricted like that of the
Duray&#257;s. Though they can never enter Buddhist temples, or the
enclosures round them, they are all Buddhists. I was informed that
their social ceremonies, as well as the religious ones, that is, those
for propitiating evil spirits, whether demoniacal or planetary, closely
resemble those of the other castes; and that they, as well as the
Ro&#7693;iy&#257;s, have their own medical practitioners, astrologers,
soothsayers, and <i lang="si-latn">kapuw&#257;s</i> or officiators at
demon ceremonies.</p>
<p>The men of the <i lang="si-latn">Che&#7789;&#7789;i</i> caste, or
<i lang="si-latn">He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;s</i>, who are mentioned in
some of the stories, are either Indians, or the descendants of Indian
settlers. The <i lang="si-latn">Che&#7789;&#7789;i</i> caste is one of
great importance, and many of its members are persons of the highest
respectability and often of great wealth. The persons referred to in
these tales are only some of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31"
href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>inferior members of the race,
some of whom have little road-side shops or cultivate small fields and
gardens.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>Coming at last to the stories themselves, I may quote the words of
the late Mr. W. Goonetilleke, the learned editor of <span class=
"bibl"><i>The Orientalist</i></span>, a journal published during the
years 1884&ndash;1892, in which many folk-tales of Ceylon were given.
Mr. Goonetilleke said (vol. i. p. 36), &ldquo;What is really wanted
&hellip; are the genuine stories of the Sinhalese [and other races
also], those which are quite free from foreign influences, and have
existed among the people from time immemorial. These can only be
gathered from the inhabitants of villages and of the remoter parts of
the island into which western civilization has not yet
penetrated.&rdquo; It is an adherence to this advice, and, I may say
also, the complete absence of all attempts to give the tales a literary
appearance that the originals do not possess, which constitute the
special features of the present work.</p>
<p>Though all have been collected by myself, I have only myself written
down a very limited number from dictation. All the rest have been
written for me in Sinhalese by the narrators themselves, or by other
villagers employed by me to collect them, who wrote them just as they
were dictated. I preferred this latter method as being free from any
disturbing foreign influence. Only three very short stories were
written down by me in English; two of them were related in English by a
Sinhalese gentleman, and the other, a variant of another story, was
written immediately after a Buddhist monk had related it to me in
Sinhalese.</p>
<p>The stories, as they now appear, are practically literal
translations of the written Sinhalese originals, perhaps it may be
thought in some respects too literal. My aim has been to present them
as nearly as possible in the words in which they are related in the
villages. The only liberty of any importance that I have taken has been
the insertion of an occasional word or phrase where it was evidently
omitted by the narrator, or was necessary in order to elucidate the
meaning, or complete the sense. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32"
href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was unavoidable that many expressions, such as
&ldquo;afterwards,&rdquo; &ldquo;after that,&rdquo; &ldquo;at that
time,&rdquo; &ldquo;then,&rdquo; &ldquo;again,&rdquo; with which the
village story-teller repeatedly begins his sentences, should be
deleted. Many past participles which Sinhalese grammar requires have
been transformed into the past tense, and most of the tense errors have
been corrected, and in rare instances an unmanageable sentence has been
cut in two. Such a word as &ldquo;came,&rdquo; when it expressed
&ldquo;came back,&rdquo; is sometimes translated
&ldquo;returned&rdquo;; and &ldquo;said,&rdquo; where it referred to an
answer, is occasionally turned into &ldquo;replied.&rdquo; The word
translated as &ldquo;behead,&rdquo; is merely &ldquo;cut&rdquo; in the
original; but the context sometimes shows that the other meaning is to
be understood.</p>
<p>In other respects, the reader may rely on having here the tales in
their true village forms, and expressed in the same simple manner. I
have even left one peculiar idiom that is often used, according to
which a question is described as being asked, or a statement made,
&ldquo;at the hand&rdquo; of a person; but I do not follow the village
story-teller in using this form in conversations carried on with the
lower animals. It is quite usual in Sinhalese to state that a question
was asked by a person &ldquo;at the hand&rdquo; (<i>lit.</i>
&ldquo;from the hand,&rdquo; the same word meaning also
&ldquo;fore-paw&rdquo;) of a jackal, a deer, or a reptile. It will be
seen that I have not attempted to translate the interjections into
English.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that in the majority of the tales the characters
are introduced in the present tense, which is then abandoned. The
narrators sometimes relapse into it afterwards, but as a rule, unless
action is being emphasised, I have adhered to the past tense in such
instances, excepting in the stories told by the Village Vaedd&#257;s
and the lowest castes, in which it seemed advisable to make as little
change as possible.</p>
<p>Attention may be invited to the tales told by the lowest castes,
probably the only stories of theirs that have ever been collected in
Ceylon. From the Tom-tom Beaters a considerable number were obtained,
some of which will appear in a later volume. The few tales that have
been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>told by the Ro&#7693;iy&#257;s and Kinnar&#257;s
are very simple; the chief fact is that they have any to tell.</p>
<p>It appeared to be likely that some of the Sindbad series of
adventures might be found in Ceylon, but inquiries made in different
districts, including part of the west coast, failed to reveal any tales
belonging to the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; with the exception of
one which probably was derived from a printed work, and orally
transmitted from one of the towns. It is still possible that some may
be found, as the Rukh is included in the Sinhalese tales, and the ogre
called R&#257;kshasa, who is a familiar personage in them, is correctly
described in his folk-tale form, in one of the Sindbad voyages. In one
story, which is not included in this work, there is the incident of the
demon who was imprisoned in a bottle. The demon was M&#257;ra, Death
personified, and his captor was a Vedar&#257;la, or medical
practitioner. The age of the tale is uncertain.</p>
<p>It is evident that many of the stories belong to distant times, but
there is little to indicate their age more definitely. In one tale
only, of this volume, the money mentioned is the <i lang=
"si-latn">kahawa&#7751;uwa</i>, in old Sinhalese <i lang=
"si-latn">kahawa&#7751;a</i>, the P&#257;li <i lang=
"pi-latn">kah&#257;pa&#7751;a</i>, a coin that ceased to be current by
the tenth or eleventh century <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, if not
considerably earlier. Commonly, we find that the coinage is the
<i lang="si-latn">masurama</i>, plural <i lang="si-latn">masuran</i>,
which came into use in the eleventh century and was not coined after
the thirteenth; but of course this is far from proving that the stories
in which it occurs are not of much earlier date. There are no
references to the Portuguese, who arrived in Ceylon at the beginning of
the sixteenth century, or to later foreign residents; but a Tamil king
is mentioned.</p>
<p>Although a large number of the stories relate the adventures of
Kings, Queens, Princes and Princesses, it will be observed that these
personages sometimes behave like ordinary villagers. The Queen or
Princess often cooks the rice for the family meal; Sir Bartle Frere has
stated in the notes at the end of <span class="bibl"><i>Old Deccan
Days</i>, p. 324</span>, that this &ldquo;would be nothing unusual in
the house of a Rajah&#8202;&hellip;. It is still the most natural
precaution he can take against <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34"
href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>poison, to eat nothing but what
has been prepared by his own wife or daughter, or under their eye in
his own zenana, and there are few accomplishments on which an Indian
Princess prides herself more than on her skill in cookery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not to be understood that such persons in these stories are
supposed to be members of the family of the ruling monarch of Ceylon.
These so-called &ldquo;kings,&rdquo; ruling over a small district or
even a single city, are in reality some of the more important <i lang=
"si-latn">parumakas</i> or feudal chiefs of the inscriptions of
pre-Christian or early post-Christian years. This old title does not
make its appearance in the stories, however.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e1558" title=
"Source: Vaedda">Vaedd&#257;</span> rulers who are termed
&ldquo;kings&rdquo; receive notice in three stories. In one which was
given in <span class="bibl"><i>Ancient Ceylon</i>, p. 93</span>, a
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1566" title=
"Source: Vaedda">Vaedd&#257;</span> youth was appointed the king of a
Sinhalese district, which is stated to have prospered under his rule.
In a tale in the present volume (No. <a href="#s4">4</a>) reference is
made to a <span class="corr" id="xd26e1572" title=
"Source: Vaedda">Vaedd&#257;</span> &ldquo;king&rdquo; who dwelt in a
forest, and who arrested some travellers and imprisoned them in what is
termed a house. In another story, which is not included here, there is
an account of another <span class="corr" id="xd26e1575" title=
"Source: Vaedda">Vaedd&#257;</span> &ldquo;king&rdquo; who lived in a
forest, and who ordered his archers to kill a prince who had succeeded
to the sovereignty of a neighbouring district on the death of his
father, and was proceeding there in order to assume it. His offence lay
in travelling through the forest without first obtaining the permission
of the <span class="corr" id="xd26e1579" title=
"Source: Vaedda">Vaedd&#257;</span> ruler. We also find references to
Vaedd&#257;s who were accustomed to enter the towns; one of them laid a
complaint before a Sinhalese &ldquo;king&rdquo; that a person had
threatened to kill him in the forest. Probably in all these instances
we have a true picture of the actual position, in early times, of some
of the Vaedd&#257;s who had not yet adopted, or had abandoned, the
village life. Their chiefs were practically independent in their wild
forests.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasas (in village spelling <i lang=
"si-latn">R&#257;say&#257;</i>, <i lang="si-latn">R&#257;s&#299;</i>)
who are introduced into many tales are ogres like those of Europe. The
Yak&#257;s are always demons or evil spirits, of little intelligence,
often having a human appearance but black in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>colour.
They live chiefly upon human flesh, like the ogres, and possess like
them some supernatural powers.</p>
<p>With regard to the animals mentioned, it is strange to find such
prominence accorded to the Lion, which has never existed in a wild
state in Ceylon. Its characteristics are correctly described, even
including its ear-splitting roar.</p>
<p>The place taken by the Fox of European tales is filled by the
Jackal, full of craft and stratagems, but sometimes over-reaching
himself. The Hare and Turtle are represented as surpassing all the
animals in cleverness, as in African and American Negro stories.</p>
<p>Of all the animals, the poor Leopard is relegated to the lowest
place, both as regards want of intelligence and cowardice; and in only
one adventure does he come off better than the Jackal. Even in that one
his position is a despicable one, and he is completely cowed by a
little Mouse-deer, the clever animal of Malay stories. In Ceylon the
Leopard occupies the place taken in India by the foolish Tiger.</p>
<p>It is perhaps the chief merit of these stories, and certainly a
feature which gives them a permanent value, that we have in them the
only existing picture of the village life of ancient times, painted by
the villagers themselves. From the histories we can learn practically
nothing regarding the life of those of the ancient inhabitants of
Ceylon who were not monks or connected with royalty, or the conditions
under which they existed. It is here alone that the reader finds the
daily experiences and the ideas and beliefs of the villagers gradually
unfolded before him. In some of the stories we may see how the village
life went on in the early centuries after Christ, and how little it has
changed since that time. Others doubtless contain particulars which
belong to a much later period, and in some there is an incongruous
mixture of the old and the new, as when the slates of school children
are introduced into what is evidently a tale of considerable age.</p>
<p>In the case of stories like these, composed for the amusement of
villagers only, and related by villagers to other villagers, it might
be expected that a considerable number <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>of objectionable
expressions would occur. So far from this being the fact, I am able to
state with much satisfaction that in only three or four instances in
this volume has it been thought desirable to slightly modify any part
of the stories. It is to be remembered that it is not the function of
these tales in general to inculcate ideas of morality or propriety,
although kindness of heart is always represented as meeting with some
adequate reward or success, and the wicked and cruel are punished in
most cases. But successful trickery and clever stratagems are always
quoted approvingly, and are favourite themes in the tales which are
most evidently of entirely local origin. In this respect they do not
differ from many Indian stories. Undaunted bravery, and also
self-abnegation and deep affection, are characteristics which are
displayed by many of the heroes and heroines; but untruthfulness is
practised, and is never condemned.</p>
<p>The instances of polygamy are almost confined to the members of the
royal families; there is one case of polyandry in which both the
husbands were brothers. Infanticide was practised; in one tale a woman
is recommended to kill her infant son because his horoscope was said to
be unpropitious, and in another the parents abandoned their newly-born
infant in order to carry home some fruit. In a story that is not
included in this volume, a king is described as ordering all his female
children to be killed immediately after birth. In another tale which is
not given here, another king is stated to have sold his children during
a time of scarcity.</p>
<p>These &ldquo;kings,&rdquo; however, are almost always depicted in an
unfavourable light. They are represented as cowardly, selfish,
licentious, unintelligent, and headstrong, ordering their sons or
others to be executed for very slight faults, in sudden fits of anger.
Murders are referred to as being commonly committed with impunity, and
by no means of unusual occurrence. One man is said to have exchanged
his wife for a bullock.</p>
<p>Yet although the story-tellers do not relate social events which
were not within the range of the common experience <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>or
traditions of the people at the time when the tales were invented, it
may be doubted if the great mass of the villagers differed much as
regards crime and morality from those of the present day. The humdrum
life of the ordinary villager did not appeal to the story-teller, who
required more stirring incidents. It is not necessary to assume that
such events were of everyday occurrence.</p>
<p>Considering the situation of Ceylon and the Indian origin of the
people, it was certain that numerous tales would be similar to those of
India, if not identical with them; but, with the exception of the story
of the Creation, there are merely bare references to the Indian deities
in about four of the tales in this volume.</p>
<p>The great majority of the folk-tales collected by me, and almost the
whole of those given in this volume, come from districts of the far
interior of the island, where story-books in Sinhalese, Tamil,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1617src" href="#xd26e1617" name="xd26e1617src">4</a>
or Arabic do not appear to have penetrated, and English is unknown by
the villagers. Such tales are therefore nearly free from modern
extraneous influences, and must be looked upon as often of genuine
Sinhalese origin, even when they utilise the usual stock incidents of
Indian folk-stories. A very few which resemble J&#257;taka stories may
owe their dissemination to Buddhist teaching, and doubtless some also
were orally transmitted by immigrants who were often of South Indian
nationality&mdash;as their similarity to South Indian stories
shows&mdash;or in some instances may have been settlers from the Ganges
valley, or near it.</p>
<p>With regard to the latter, it is not probable that they consisted
only of the early immigrants of pre-Christian times. King
Ni&#347;&#347;anka-Malla, who reigned from 1198 to 1207 <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span>, has recorded in his inscriptions that he was a native
of Sinhapura, then apparently the capital of the K&#257;linga kingdom,
which extended far down the east coast of India, southward from the
lower part of the Ganges valley; and he and his Chief Queen
Subhadr&#257;, a K&#257;linga Princess, must have brought into Ceylon
many of their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>fellow-countrymen. The Queens of two other earlier
Kings of Ceylon were also Princesses from K&#257;linga.</p>
<p>In the Galpota inscription at Polannaruwa (<span class="bibl">Prof.
E. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s <i>Ancient Inscriptions in Ceylon</i>, No.
148</span>), he stated that &ldquo;invited by the King
[Par&#257;krama-B&#257;hu I], who was his senior kinsman, to come and
reign over his hereditary kingdom of Lakdiva [Ceylon], V&#299;ra
Ni&#347;&#347;an&#805;ka-Malla landed with a great retinue in
Lan&#805;k&#257;&rdquo; [Ceylon]. Further on in the same inscription he
stated that &ldquo;he sent to the country of K&#257;linga, and caused
many Princesses of the Soma and S&#363;rya races to be brought
hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A connexion with the K&#257;linga kingdom seems to have been
maintained from early times. In his inscriptions the same king claimed
that the sovereignty of Ceylon belonged by right to the K&#257;linga
dynasty. He described himself in his Dambulla inscription (<span class=
"bibl"><i>Ancient Inscriptions</i>, No. 143</span>), as &ldquo;the
liege lord of Lakdiva by right of birth, deriving descent from the race
of King Wijaya,&rdquo; the first king of Ceylon, who according to the
Sinhalese historical works was also born at a town called Sinhapura,
which is stated to have been founded by his father. In the Galpota
inscription we read of &ldquo;Princes of the K&#257;linga race to whom
the island of Lan&#805;k&#257; has been peculiarly appropriate since
the reign of Wijaya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ni&#347;&#347;anka-Malla was succeeded by his elder half-brother,
S&#257;hasa-Malla, who remarked in his Polannaruwa inscription
(<span class="bibl"><i>Anc. Inscriptions</i>, No. 156</span>) that he
also was born at Sinhapura. He, too, claimed that Wijaya was a member
of their family. He said, &ldquo;Because King Wijaya, having destroyed
the Yakshas, established Lan&#805;k&#257; like a field made by rooting
out the stumps, it is a place much protected by Kings from this very
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it will be seen that stories which are current in Central
India, or the lower part of the Ganges Valley, or even the Panj&#257;b,
as well as tales of Indian animals such as the Lion, may have been
brought direct to Ceylon by immigrants from K&#257;linga, or Magadha,
or Bengal. Apparently it is in this manner that the evident connexion
between the tales of Ceylon and Kashm&#299;r is to be explained,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>the stories passing from Magadha or neighbouring
districts, to Kashm&#299;r on the one side, and from Magadha or
K&#257;linga to Ceylon on the other.</p>
<p>To show the connexion of the Sinhalese stories with those of India,
the outlines of some Indian parallels have been appended after each
tale, as well as a very few from the interior of Western Africa; but no
European variants, except in two instances, where they are inserted for
the benefit of readers in Ceylon.</p>
<p>The stories have been arranged in two parts. In the first one are
those told by members of the Cultivating Caste and Village
Vaedd&#257;s; in the second one those related of or by members of lower
castes. Those of each caste are given consecutively, the animal stories
in each case coming last.</p>
<p>The general reader is advised to pay no attention to diacritical
marks or dots which indicate separate letters in the Sinhalese
alphabet, or to note only the long vowels. In all cases <i>ae</i> is to
be pronounced as a diphthong, like a in &ldquo;hat,&rdquo; and not to
rhyme with &ldquo;me.&rdquo; It is short where not marked long.</p>
<p>Enough material has been collected for a second volume, which it is
hoped may be published next year.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>As reference has been made to the subject in the foregoing extracts
from Sinhalese inscriptions, a few lines may be added regarding the
district from which Wijaya came, and his journey to Ceylon. The
sentences that have been quoted prove that at the beginning of the
thirteenth century A.D., it was claimed by two kings of Ceylon who came
from Sinhapura in the K&#257;linga country that they were of the same
family as Wijaya.</p>
<p>At a very early date the lands along the southern bank of the Ganges
were divided into a series of states that once were independent.
Proceeding eastward in the lower part of the valley, these were
Magadha, occupying southern Bih&#257;r, with its capital R&#257;jagaha
(called also R&#257;jagriha and Girivraja), afterwards abandoned in
favour of P&#257;&#7789;aliputta, near Patn&#257;; Anga, separated from
it by the river Camp&#257; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href=
"#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>(<i>c</i> pronounced as <i>ch</i>),
on which was its capital Camp&#257;; Vanga or Banga, probably extending
on both sides of the Ganges, and forming part of the modern Bengal; and
T&#257;malitta, or T&#257;mralipta, with a capital of the same name at
Tamluk, near the southern mouth of the Ganges. Extending along the east
coast was K&#257;linga; and between it and Magadha and Anga came the
Pu&#7751;&#7693;ra and &#332;&#7693;ra states, the latter occupying
part of Orissa.</p>
<p>An old legend recorded that several of these states had a common
origin. It was said that the wife of a Y&#257;dava king Vali or Bali
had five sons, Anga, Vanga, K&#257;linga, Pu&#7751;&#7693;ra and
&#332;&#7693;ra or Sunga, each of whom founded a separate state. The
names of the first four are grouped together several times in the
Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata, as taking part with K&#333;&#347;ala and
Magadha in the great legendary fight against the
P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;avas, and on one day the troops from Magadha and
K&#257;linga are said to have formed, with another people, one wing of
the Kuru army.</p>
<p>Regarding K&#257;linga, Pliny gives the name of a race called the
Maccocaling&aelig;, who have been thought to belong to Orissa, and he
wrote that the Modogaling&aelig; occupied a very large island in the
Ganges, that is, apparently part of the delta.</p>
<p>At a later date there were said to be three districts called
collectively Trik&#257;linga. Whether these were portions of the more
southern part of the K&#257;linga country only, or included the land of
the Modogaling&aelig;, is not clear. If the K&#257;linga kingdom once
included the territory of the Modogaling&aelig;, the T&#257;malitta
district would be part of the K&#257;linga country at that time; but
apparently Vanga was unconnected with K&#257;linga, the two being
mentioned as separate kingdoms.</p>
<p>Divested of its impossibilities, the story of Wijaya&rsquo;s
ancestry which is contained in the Sinhalese histories is that a king
of Vanga, who had married the daughter of a king of K&#257;linga, had a
daughter who joined a caravan that was proceeding to Magadha. On the
way, either a robber chief called S&#299;ha, &ldquo;Lion,&rdquo;
attacked and plundered the caravan, and carried off the Princess, or
she joined a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>member of the caravan who had that name. They
settled down in a wild tract of country termed L&#257;l&#803;a, near
the western border of the Vanga territory. There she had two
children&mdash;the eldest being S&#299;ha-B&#257;hu&mdash;with whom she
afterwards returned to the Vanga capital, where her cousin Anura, who
became King of Vanga, is said to have married her. Her son
S&#299;ha-B&#257;hu went back to his father&rsquo;s district,
L&#257;l&#803;a, founded a town called S&#299;hapura or Sinhapura, and
lived there as the ruler of the country around. Evidently it was a
subordinate district belonging to Vanga; it is stated that the Vanga
king granted it to him (<span class="bibl"><i>Mah.</i> i. p.
31</span>). It is not mentioned in the R&#257;m&#257;yana, the
Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata, the J&#257;taka stories, or in the lists of
countries given in the Pur&#257;nas to which I have access; but the
people of L&#257;&#7789;a are referred to in a tenth century grant from
Bh&#257;galpur, a town on territory that once formed the eastern part
of Magadha (<span class="bibl"><i>Indo-Aryans</i>, by Dr. R. Mitra, ii.
273</span>).</p>
<p>The first marriage or elopement of the Princess does not appear to
have affected the status of her son S&#299;ha-B&#257;hu. According to
the histories, his eldest son, Wijaya, eventually married the daughter
of the P&#257;&#7751;&#7693;iyan king of the southern Madura, and his
second son, Sumitta, who succeeded him, married the daughter of the
King of Madda or Madra, probably a small eastern state of that name,
rather than the distant Madda in the Panj&#257;b.</p>
<p>The Sinhalese histories record that Wijaya was exiled on account of
his lawless behaviour, but the truth of this statement may be doubted,
and it is a suspicious fact that this part of the story resembles
folk-tales from Kashm&#299;r.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1704src" href=
"#xd26e1704" name="xd26e1704src">5</a> We are informed in those works
not only that he was exiled, but that he was also forcibly deported by
sea, together with seven hundred followers, and their wives and
children, that is, two or three thousand persons.</p>
<p>All that is actually credible in this incident is that for a reason
which is unknown, perhaps a love of adventure, or possibly at the
solicitation of traders who had settled there, he proceeded by sea to
Ceylon, where he became the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>first Sinhalese king. Most probably
he accompanied a party of Magadhese or other merchants.</p>
<p>It is recorded that from an early period vessels sailed across the
Bay of Bengal from various ports on the Ganges. In the J&#257;taka
stories some are mentioned as passing down the Ganges from Benares with
traders, and being far out at sea for several days, and even going to
Suva&#7751;&#7751;a Bh&#363;mi (Burma) and back. T&#257;malitta was a
famous port in early times and for many centuries; and there is a
definite and credible statement that vessels sailed direct from it to
Ceylon in the reign of A&#347;&#333;ka, in the third century
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> There is no reason to suppose that similar
voyages were not undertaken long prior to the period during which the
J&#257;takas were being composed. If they are not mentioned in earlier
Buddhist works, this may have been merely owing to the fact that their
authors felt no interest in the trade of the countries near the mouth
of the Ganges.</p>
<p>In the presence of such evidence of the sea-going capabilities of
the vessels which sailed from the ports on the Ganges, the statement of
the Sinhalese histories that Wijaya embarked at Baroach, on the western
coast, whether accompanied by a large party of followers and numerous
women and children or not, cannot be credited. It is impossible to
believe that any travellers who wished to proceed to Ceylon in the
fifth century <span class="sc">B.C</span>., from a district lying
between Anga and Vanga, and probably within a few miles of a port from
which vessels sailed, would not step on board a ship at their own
doors, so to speak, rather than undertake an arduous journey across
several other countries, in order to embark at a port more than eight
hundred miles away in a direct line, which when reached was still no
nearer their destination.</p>
<p>In any case, there is no likelihood that a large number of women and
children were taken, unless we are prepared to accept the improbable
hypothesis that a fleet of ships was expressly chartered for the
voyage. In the case of the small vessels which ventured on such long
trading expeditions, every foot of storage space would be required for
the goods that were carried, and for the accommodation of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>merchants who went to exchange these for the
products of the ports at which they called. It is most unlikely that
many other passengers were ever carried so far in Indian ships in early
times, notwithstanding fanciful tales of imaginary ships with hundreds
on board, in the J&#257;taka stories.</p>
<p>Ni&#347;&#347;anka-Malla and his brother do not claim that the
Sinhapura at which they were born was the city founded by
Wijaya&rsquo;s father. It is possible, however, that they could trace
some distant connexion with the L&#257;l&#803;a family, and it has been
noted already that Wijaya&rsquo;s great-great-grandfather was said to
be a king of K&#257;linga.</p>

<p class="first">With regard to the exorcism of the flies, I give a
relation of the similar treatment of locusts in Abyssinia, by Father
Francis Alvarez, who visited that country in 1520, in the suite of a
Portuguese Ambassador. The account is appended in Pory&rsquo;s
translation of the <span class="bibl"><i>History of Africa</i>, by Leo
Africanus, 1600, p. 352</span>. An appeal having been made to Alvarez
to drive away an enormous flight of locusts, &ldquo;<span lang=
"en">which to our iudgement couered fower and twentie miles of
lande,</span>&rdquo; the following is his own record of the
proceedings:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="en">&ldquo;And so I went to the Ambassadour, and told him,
that it would be very good to goe on procession, beseeching God that
hee woulde deliuer the countrie, who peraduenture in his great mercie
might heare vs. This liked the Ambassadour very well: and the day
following we gathered togither the people of the land, with all the
priests, and taking the consecrated stone, and the crosse, according to
their custome, all we Portugals sung the Letanie, and appointed those
of the land, that they should lift vp their voices aloud as we did,
saying in their language <i>Zio marina Christos</i>, which is as much
to say, as Lord God haue mercy vpon vs: and with this manner of
inuocation we went ouer a peece of grounde, where there were fieldes of
wheate, for the space of a mile, euen to a little hill: and heere I
caused many of these locustes to be taken, pronouncing ouer them a
certaine coniuration, which I had about me in writing, hauing made it
that night, requesting, admonishing, and excommunicating them,
enioining them within the space of three howers to depart towards the
sea, or the lande of the Moores, or the desert mountaines, and to let
the Christians alone: and they not performing this, I summoned and
charged the birdes of heauen, the beasts of the earth, and all sorts of
tempests, to scatter, destroy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44"
href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>and eate vp their bodies: and to
this effect I tooke a quantitie of locusts, making this admonition to
them present, in the behalfe likewise of them absent,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1751src" href="#xd26e1751" name="xd26e1751src">6</a> and so
giuing them libertie, I suffered them to depart. It pleased God to
heare us sinners, for in our returne home, they came so thicke vpon our
backes, as it seemed that they woulde haue broken our heads, or
shoulders, so hard they strooke against vs, as if we had beene beaten
with stones and cudgels, and in this sort they went towards the sea:
The men, women, and children remaining at home, were gotten vpon the
tops, or tarrasses of their houses, giuing God thankes that the locusts
were going away, some afore, and others followed. In the meane while
towardes the sea, there arose a great cloude with thunder, which met
them full in the teeth, and continued for the space of three howers
with much raine, and tempest, that filled all the riuers, and when the
raine ceased, it was a fearefull thing to behold the dead Locustes,
which were more then two yardes [<i>marginal note</i>, or fathomes] in
height vpon the bankes of the riuers, and in some riuers there were
mightie heapes of them, so that the morning following there was not one
of them found aliue vpon the earth.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Making of the Great Earth</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From the earliest time, the whole of this world, being
filled up and overflowed by a great rain, and being completely
destroyed, was in darkness. There were neither men, nor living beings,
nor anything whatever.</p>
<p>During the time while it was in this state, Great Vishnu thought,
&ldquo;In what manner, having lowered the water, should the earth be
established?&rdquo; Having thought this, Great Vishnu went to the God
Saman. Having gone there, he asked at the hand of the God Saman,
&ldquo;What is the way to establish this earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The God Saman replied, &ldquo;There is no one among us [gods] who
can establish this earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the God Great Vishnu asked, &ldquo;Then who is able to do
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The God Saman said, &ldquo;You must go to the residence of
R&#257;hu; he can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the God Great Vishnu went to the abode of R&#257;hu, and
spoke to R&#257;hu, the Asura Chief<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1788src"
href="#xd26e1788" name="xd26e1788src">1</a>: &ldquo;R&#257;hu, Asura
Chief, our residence has been swallowed up by water; on account of that
can even you make us an earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then R&#257;hu, the Asura Chief, said, &ldquo;Countless beings
having gone to the world of Brahm&#257; (i.e., having been destroyed in
the water), how can I descend into the water which is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The God Great Vishnu asked, &ldquo;In what way, then, can you make
the earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>R&#257;hu told him to put a lotus seed into the water. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>After that, the God Great Vishnu, having returned to this world,
placed a lotus seed in the water. Having placed it there, in seven days
the lotus seed sprouted.</p>
<p>Then the God Vishnu again went to the dwelling-place of R&#257;hu.
Having gone there, he spoke to R&#257;hu, the Asura Chief: &ldquo;The
lotus plant has now sprouted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards R&#257;hu arose, and came with the God Vishnu to this
world. Having made ready to descend into the water, he asked Great
Vishnu, &ldquo;What thing am I to bring up from the bottom of the
water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Great Vishnu said, &ldquo;I do not want any [special] thing;
bring a handful of sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>R&#257;hu, having said &ldquo;H&#257;&rdquo; (Yes), descending along
that lotus stalk proceeded until he met with the earth. Having
descended to the earth in seven days, taking a handful of sand he
returned to the surface again in seven days more. Having come there, he
gave the handful of sand into the hand of the God Great Vishnu.</p>
<p>After it was given, taking it and squeezing it in his hand, the God
Great Vishnu placed it on the water. Having placed it there the God
Great Vishnu made the resolution: &ldquo;This water having dried up,
may the Earth be created.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, that small quantity of sand not going to the bottom, but
turning and turning round on the surface of the water, the water began
to diminish. Thus, in that manner, in three months and three-quarters
of the moon, the water having diminished, the earth was made.</p>
<p>After it was formed, this world was there in darkness for a long
time. [After the light had appeared], the God Great Vishnu thought:
&ldquo;We must make men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gone to the God Saman he said, &ldquo;What is the use of
being the owner of this world when it is in this state? We must make
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The God Saman said, &ldquo;Let us two make them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then those two spoke to each other: &ldquo;Let us first of all make
a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying that, they made a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a from that earth, and
having given breath to the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a those two told him to
arise. Then the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a arose by the power of those
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>Gods; and having arisen, that Br&#257;hma&#7751;a
conversed with those Gods.</p>
<p>Then the God Vishnu said, &ldquo;Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, for thy
assistance thou art to make for thyself a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a by the power of those very Gods
made a woman, and from that time men began to increase in number up to
to-day.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is evidently a story of the last creation. In
Hinduism there is a series of four ages termed Yugas, each ended by a
destruction of the world by fire, which is quenched by cataclysmal
rainfall. These are the Krita, Tr&#275;ta, Dw&#257;para, and Kali
Yugas, their periods being respectively 4,000, 3,000, 2,000, and 1,000
divine years. There are also intermediate periods equal to one-tenth of
each of the adjoining Yugas. A divine year being 360 times as long as a
human year, the whole series, called a Maha Yuga, amounts to about
4,320,000 years (<span class="bibl"><i>Vishnu Pur&#257;na</i>, Wilson,
p. 24</span>). When a series is ended the order is reversed, that is,
the Kali Yuga, which is the present one, is followed by the
Dw&#257;para.</p>
<p>The <span class="bibl"><i>Vishnu Pur&#257;na</i>, p. 12</span>, thus
describes the state of things before the original creation:
&ldquo;There was neither day nor night, nor sky nor earth, nor darkness
nor light, nor any other thing, save only One&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the
Universal Soul,&rdquo; the All-God, Vishnu in the form of
Brahm&#257;.</p>
<p>His action is thus summarised: &ldquo;Affecting then the quality of
activity Hari [Vishnu], the Lord of all, himself becoming Brahm&#257;,
engaged in the creation of the universe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of the Yuga, &ldquo;the same mighty deity,
Jan&#257;rddana, invested with the quality of darkness, assumes the
awful form of Rudra, and swallows up the universe. Having thus devoured
all things, and converted the world into one vast ocean, the Supreme
reposes on his mighty serpent couch amidst the deep: he awakes after a
season, and again, as Brahm&#257;, becomes the author of creation
(<span class="bibl"><i><abbr title=
"Vishnu Pur&#257;na">V.P.</abbr></i>, p. 19</span>).</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i>
(Tawney), vol. ii, p. 583</span>, there were two D&#257;navas, a form
of Asura, &ldquo;invincible even by gods,&rdquo; who impeded
Praj&#257;pati in his work of creation. The only way which the Creator
could hit upon to destroy them was to create two lovely maidens, one
black and one white. Each of the D&#257;navas wished to carry off both,
so they fought over them and killed each other.</p>
<p>It is only in the Sinhalese story that we find an Asura assisting in
the creation. R&#257;hu is usually known as a dark planetary sign, a
dragon&rsquo;s head, which endeavours to swallow the sun and moon, and
thus causes eclipses, at which time, only, it is seen. In the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>account of the great Churning of the Ocean, it is
evident that he was supposed originally to have, or to be able to
assume, a figure indistinguishable from those of the Gods.</p>
<p>The story of the application of Vishnu for R&#257;hu&rsquo;s
assistance is based on the Indian notion that the Asuras were of more
ancient date than the Gods. The Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata states that they
were the elder brothers of the Gods, and were more powerful than the
Gods, who were unable to conquer them in their strongholds under the
sea. The God Saman is Indra, the elder brother of Vishnu.</p>
<p>According to the Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata, Vishnu assuming the form of
a boar raised the earth to the surface of the waters (which covered it
to the depth of one hundred y&#333;janas), on his tusk, without the aid
of any other deity.</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following accounts of the state of things in very
early times are borrowed from <span class="bibl"><i>The
Orientalist</i>, vol. iii., pp. 79 and 78</span>, to which they were
contributed by Mr. D. A. Jayawardana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the primitive good old days the sky was not so far off
from the earth as at present. The sun and moon in their course through
the heavens sometimes came in close contact with the house-tops. The
stars were stationed so close to the earth that they served as lamps to
the houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time, there was a servant-maid who was repeatedly
disturbed by the passing clouds when she was sweeping the compound [the
enclosure round the house], and this was to her a real nuisance. One
cloudy morning, when this naughty girl was sweeping the compound as
usual, the clouds came frequently in contact with the broom-stick and
interfered with her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Losing all patience she gave a smart blow to the firmament
with the broom-stick, saying, &lsquo;Get away from hence.&rsquo; The
sky, as a matter of course, was quite ashamed at the affront<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1888src" href="#xd26e1888" name="xd26e1888src">2</a>
thus offered to it by a servant-girl, and flew away far, far out of
human reach, in order to avoid a similar catastrophe again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second account is as follows: &ldquo;Till a long period after
the creation, man did not know the use of most of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>vegetables now used by him for food. His food at
first consisted of some substance like boiled milk, which then grew
spontaneously upon the earth. This substance since disappeared, and
rice took its place, and grew abundantly without the husk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jak fruit (<i lang="la">Artocarpus integrifolia</i>), one
of the principal articles of food of the Sinhalese, was not even
touched, as it was thought to be poisonous. The God &#346;akra [Indra]
bethought himself of teaching mankind that Jak was not a deadly fruit,
but an article of wholesome food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story goes on to relate that, assuming the form of an old man,
he got a woman to boil some Jak seeds for him, with injunctions not to
eat them or she would die; but the smell being appetizing she first
tasted one, and then ate a quantity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman and a man, it
is said. There are also the children of those two persons, the elder
brother and younger brother and elder sister. Well then, while these
three persons were there, the man having died those children provided
subsistence for the mother of the three.</p>
<p>One day the three persons went to join a party of friends in
assisting a neighbour in his work.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1912src"
href="#xd26e1912" name="xd26e1912src">1</a> That mother stayed at home.
For that woman there was not a thing to eat. Should those persons bring
food, she eats; if not, not.</p>
<p>When the three persons were eating the food provided for the working
party, the elder sister and the elder brother having eaten silently,
without even a [thought of the] matter of their mother, came away home.
The younger brother thought, &ldquo;An&#275;! We three persons having
eaten here, on our going how about food for our mother? I must take
some.&rdquo; Placing a similar quantity of cooked rice and a little
vegetable curry under the corner of his finger nail, the three came
back.</p>
<p>Then the mother asked at the hand of the elder sister, &ldquo;Where,
daughter, is cooked rice and vegetable curry for me?&rdquo; She said,
&ldquo;I have not brought any. Having indeed eaten I came
[empty-handed].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the mother said to the daughter, &ldquo;Thou wilt be cooked in
hell itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having called the elder son she asked, &ldquo;Where, son, is the
cooked rice and vegetable curry for me?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>The son said, &ldquo;Mother, I have not brought it. Having indeed
eaten, I came [empty-handed].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the mother said to the son, &ldquo;Be off, very
speedily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having called the young younger brother she asked, &ldquo;Where,
son, is cooked rice and vegetable curry for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then that son said, &ldquo;Mother, hold a pot.&rdquo; After that,
the mother brought it and <span class="corr" id="xd26e1936" title=
"Source: eld">held</span> it. The son struck down his finger nail in
it. Then the pot was filled and overflowed.</p>
<p>Afterwards the mother, having eaten the rice and curry, gave
authority to those three persons, to the elder brother, to the younger
brother, and to the sister older than both of them.</p>
<p>Firstly, having called the elder sister she said, &ldquo;Thou shalt
be cooked even in hell.&rdquo; That elder sister herself now having
become Great Paddy,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1943src" href=
"#xd26e1943" name="xd26e1943src">2</a> while in hell is cooked in
mud.</p>
<p>She told the eldest son to go speedily. That elder brother himself
having become the Sun, goes very speedily. For the Sun, in very truth
(<i lang="si-latn">aett&#275;ma</i>), there is no rest. In the little
time in which the eyelids fall, the Sun goes seven gawwas,<a class=

across (<i lang="si-latn">harahin</i>).<a class="noteref" id=

"#xd26e1962" name="xd26e1962src">5</a> the Great Paddy represents the
elder sister.</p>
<p>Having called the younger son she said, &ldquo;My son, go you in the

Mother.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country a man having been stricken by the
evil influence (<i lang="si-latn">apal&#275;</i>) of Senasur&#257;, any
cultivation work or anything whatever which the man performs does not
go on properly.</p>
<p>The man having become very poor said, &ldquo;I cannot stay in this
country; I must go to another country&rdquo;; and having gone away from
that country he sat down at a travellers&rsquo; shed. During the time
while he was there a friend of the man&rsquo;s came there. That man,
sitting down in the travellers&rsquo; shed, said, &ldquo;Friend, where
are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man said<span class="corr" id="xd26e1994" title=
"Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;What is it, friend? Well then,
according to my reckoning there is no means of subsistence for me. I am
going away to some country or other, to look if I shall obtain a
livelihood.&rdquo; [He told him how everything that he did failed,
owing to the ill-will of Senasur&#257;.]</p>
<p>Then the friend said, &ldquo;Friend, don&rsquo;t you go in that
way<span class="corr" id="xd26e1999" title="Not in source">;</span> I
will tell you a good stratagem. Having gone back to your village, when
dry weather sets in cut chenas; when rain falls do rice field
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man having come back again to his village, began to cut a chena.
At the time when he was cutting the chena rain rained. Then, having
dropped the chena cutting, he went to plough the rice field. Then dry
weather again began to set in. Again having gone he chops the chena.
Then rain rained. Again having gone he ploughs the rice field.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>In that manner he did the chena and rice field
works, both of them. Having done the work, the [crops in the] chena and
the rice field, both of them, ripened.</p>
<p>After that, Senasur&#257; said at the hand of the man, &ldquo;What
of their ripening! I will not give more than an amuna (5&middot;7
bushels) from a stack. Let it be so settled (<i lang=
"si-latn">aswanu</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, having cut the rice crop, the man began to make the
stacks separately of two or three sheaves apiece. Then having trampled
out [the corn in] the stacks [by means of buffaloes] at the rate of the
amuna from the stack&mdash;should there be one sheaf in it, an amuna;
should there be two sheaves, an amuna&mdash;in that manner having
trampled out [the corn in] the stacks he filled up two corn stores.
Having cut the millet in the chena he filled up two corn stores of
millet.</p>
<p>In that very country there is an astrologer (<i lang=
"si-latn">naekatr&#257;la</i>). Having gone to him, he informed the
astrologer of the evil influence that there was from Senasur&#257; [and
how he had outwitted him]. Then the astrologer said, &ldquo;Until the
time when you die the evil influence of Senasur&#257; over you will not
be laid aside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;Can you tell me the place where Senasur&#257;
is [and what I must say to him]?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astrologer replied, &ldquo;Senasur&#257; having taken a
man&rsquo;s disguise and come to your house, will talk with you. Then
say, &lsquo;The evil influence of Senasur&#257; has been over me. I did
a good trick for it. I worked in both a chena and a rice field. I got
the things into the corn stores. While staying here eating them I can
do cultivation again [in the same way].<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2023" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards this man came home. While he was there, on the day
foretold by the astrologer Senasur&#257; came. The man having given him
sitting accommodation asked, &ldquo;Where are you going<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e2028" title=
"Source: &rsquo;?&rsquo;">?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Then Senasur&#257; said, &ldquo;It is I indeed whom they call
Senasur&#257;, the Divine King. Because of it tell me any matter you
require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the man said, &ldquo;What is the matter I require? I have become
very poor, having been stricken by the evil influence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>of
Senasur&#257;. Now then, I want an assistance from you for
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards Senasur&#257;, the Divine King, having given the man a
book said, &ldquo;Without showing this book to anybody, place it in
your house. Remain here, and make obeisance [to me] three times a day,
having looked and looked into [the instructions in] the book. From any
journey on which you may go, from any work you may do, you will obtain
victory [that is, success].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, Senasur&#257;, the Divine King, went away. After
that, having remained there in the very manner told by Senasur&#257;,
the man became a person of much substance.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Glass Princess</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are seven Princes, the sons
of a King. When the seven persons had grown up, messengers were sent to
find the places where there were seven Princesses to be taken in
marriage by them. They obtained intelligence that there was a kingdom
where they were to be met with.</p>
<p>After that, the seven portraits of the seven Princes having been
painted, two or three ministers were summoned, and sent with the
instructions, &ldquo;Go to that kingdom, and observe if the seven
Princesses are there. If they are there, take the portraits of the
seven Princesses and come back with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ministers having gone there and looked, found that seven
Princesses were there. So they went to the King, the father of the
Princesses. After they had come, the King having given quarters to the
ministers, and having given them food and drink, asked, &ldquo;Where
are you going?&rdquo; Then the ministers said, &ldquo;On account of
news that you have seven Princesses, as there are seven Princes of the
King of our country we have come, bringing the portraits of the seven
Princes to show you, in order to marry the Princesses to those
seven.&rdquo; The King and the Princesses having looked at the
portraits were pleased with them.</p>
<p>Afterwards, a suitable occasion for the marriage having been
appointed, the portraits of the Princesses were painted, and given into
the hands of the ministers, and they were sent away with them.</p>
<p>The party having brought them, showed them to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>King and
the seven Princes. The King and the seven Princes being pleased with
those persons after they had shown the portraits, the King of that
city, on the very day appointed as the date for setting out for the
marriage, having decorated an elephant for the King and Queen, and both
of them having mounted on it, and having decorated seven other
elephants for the seven Princes, the party made ready to go.</p>
<p>Then the youngest Prince of all, having placed his sword on the back
of the elephant, and made obeisance to his father, said, &ldquo;I will
not go. Should the Princess come after being married to the sword, let
her come. If not, let her simply stop there.&rdquo; Having said this he
did not go; he sent only the elephant, and the elephant and all the
other persons went.</p>
<p>Having gone there the six Princes were married to the six
Princesses. Then the King whose Princesses they were, asked, &ldquo;Is
there not a Prince for the youngest Princess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he asked this, the King whose son was the Prince replied,
&ldquo;There is my youngest Prince. He has not come. If she will come
after being married to the sword placed on the back of this elephant,
he said she is to come; if not, he said that she is to remain
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King whose Princess she was, was not satisfied with that. What
of that? The youngest Princess was contented, and said, &ldquo;Even a
deaf man or a lame man would be good enough for me. Therefore I must be
married.&rdquo; So having been married to the sword she came away with
the others.</p>
<p>The Prince who did not go, but stayed at home, knew that there was a
pool on the way, and that there was also a Cobra which had charge of
that pool. The Prince was well aware that if the people who went to the
marriage came there, and being thirsty drank the water, that Cobra
would ask for a human offering. How was that? A deity came to the
Prince in a dream and told him. Having learnt this, the Prince went,
and at the time when they were coming hid himself near the pool, and
remained there.</p>
<p>Then all the party having come there drank the water. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>Having
drunk it, when they were setting out to come away, a large Cobra which
had been in a rock cave near by, came out, and said, &ldquo;Because you
drank water from my pool one person must remain here as an offering to
me. If not, I shall not permit even one of you to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the youngest Prince who had gone near and hidden himself
came forward, and saying, &ldquo;I will stay as the human offering; go
you away,&rdquo; he started off all that marriage party, and sent them
to their village. He said to the Princess who had come after being
married to his sword, &ldquo;Until whatever time it may be when I
return, go and stay at the palace of mine which is there. There are
servants at it. Set the party of them to work, and eat and drink in
great contentment just as though I were there.&rdquo; After he had said
this, the party returned to the city, and the youngest Prince went with
the Cobra to the cave.</p>
<p>After they had gone there, the Cobra said to the Prince,
&ldquo;There is an ulcer on my forehead. You may go after curing the
ulcer. Because of your curing it I shall not require a human
offering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and continuing to eat the
things for which it provided the expenses, stayed there. Twice a day he
washed and washed the ulcer, while applying medicine to it, but it did
not heal.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Cobra said, &ldquo;There is a certain daughter of the
King of a city, called the Glass Princess. The Princess takes any
disguise she likes and goes through the sky, supported by her power of
flying through the air. The Princess knows a medicine by which, if it
should be applied by her own hand, my ulcer will become healed;
otherwise it will not heal, and there will be no going to your village
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince replied, &ldquo;It is good. I will go and bring the Glass
Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, he set off to go to the city where the Glass
Princess lived. Having hurried along the road which led in that
direction, there was a river to which he went. When he looked up the
river he saw some rats coming floating in the water. Then what does he
do? He seizes all those few rats, and goes and places them on the bank.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>After he had put them there the rats said, &ldquo;An&#275;! O Lord,
if Your Majesty should require any assistance, be pleased to think of
us; then we will come and stay with you, and assist you.&rdquo; The
Prince said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and went to the city in which
the Glass Princess dwelt.</p>
<p>Having come there, being without a place to stay at he went to the
spot where a widow-mother was stopping, and said, &ldquo;An&#275;!
Mother, give me a mat to sleep on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow-mother said, &ldquo;It is good, son. Remain here. I am
alone here, therefore it will be good for me also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;If so, mother, cook and give me a
little rice. Having obtained some money to-morrow, I will bring it and
give you it.&rdquo; The old woman having heard his words, cooked and
gave him a little rice.</p>
<p>When she had given it and he had eaten, the Prince asked that old
woman, &ldquo;Mother, what are the new things that are happening at
this city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman replied, &ldquo;What! Son, the new matters at this
city are like those of other cities indeed; but there is one new affair
at this city. If so, what is it? The daughter, called the Glass
Princess, of the King of this city remains an [unwedded] Princess. The
Princess, creating any disguise she wants, can go through the sky
sustained by her power of flight through the air. Through the beauty of
her figure she is a very celebrated person. Because of that, many royal
Princes have come to ask to marry the Princess. Having come, they are
asked, &lsquo;What have you come for?&rsquo; When they have said,
&lsquo;We have come to take this Princess in marriage,&rsquo; the King
puts on the hearth a very great cauldron of water, and having made it
boil tells them to bathe in it without making the water lukewarm. There
is a large iron tree in the open space in front of the palace. Having
bathed in the water, he tells them to saw the iron tree in two. If they
do not bathe in the water and cut it in two, he does not permit the
Princes to go away; he beheads them there and then, and casts them
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked the old woman, &ldquo;Mother, can no one go to the
place where the Glass Princess is staying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, even a bird which passes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>along in the air above cannot go to the place
where the Glass Princess is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince asked, &ldquo;Mother, why do they say that the
Princess is the Glass Princess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman said, &ldquo;O son, they call her the Glass Princess.
The bed on which the Princess sleeps is a bed of glass throughout.
Glass is fixed all round the bed in such a manner that even the wind
cannot get to her.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2122src" href=
"#xd26e2122" name="xd26e2122src">1</a> Because of that, they say that
she is the Glass Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;Mother, at what time does the Princess eat
rice at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman said, &ldquo;O son, at night water for bathing, and
cooked rice, having gone there for the Princess, they are placed in the
upper story where the Princess sleeps alone. When the Princess has been
sleeping at night, at about eight she awakes, and after bathing in the
water eats rice. Before that she does not get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince, after listening to all these words, asked for a
mat, and went off to sleep at the travellers&rsquo; shed which was in
front of the old woman&rsquo;s house. Having gone there, while he was
lying down he thought, &ldquo;An&#275;! O Gods, in any case you must
grant me an opportunity of going to the place where that Princess
is.&rdquo; Then while he was thinking, &ldquo;An&#275;! Will even those
rats that I took up that day out of the river and placed on the bank,
become of assistance to me in this matter?&rdquo; he fell asleep.</p>
<p>After that, those rats, collecting thousands of rats besides, came
there before the Prince awoke, and having come near the Prince while he
was sleeping, waited until he awoke. When the Prince awoke and looked
about, he saw that rats, thousands in number, had come and were
there.</p>
<p>The rats asked the Prince: &ldquo;O Lord, what assistance does Your
Majesty want us to give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I want you to excavate a tunnel, of a size
so that a man can go along it erect, to the upper story of the house in
which the Glass Princess is staying, and to hand it over without
completing it, leaving a very little <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>unfinished. It was on
account of this that I thought of you.&rdquo; Then the rats went, and
having dug it out that night, finished it and handed it over, and went
away.</p>
<p>The Prince having been in the travellers&rsquo; shed until it became
light, took the mat and went to the widow-mother. He gave her one
masurama and said, &ldquo;Here, mother, this is given for the articles
I obtained. Bring things for you and me, and in order that I may go and
get something to-day also, quickly cook and give me a little
rice.&rdquo; The old woman speedily cooked and gave it. The Prince
having eaten it, during the whole day walked round about the city.</p>
<p>At night he went along the tunnel to the upper story where the
Princess was. Having gone there, when he thought of looking in the
direction of the Princess he could not through diffidence, it is said.
The Princess was asleep on the glass bed; a lamp shone brightly.</p>
<p>After that, the Prince having rubbed soap in the water which was
ready for the Glass Princess, and washed in it, and eaten half the rice
that was set on the table, and having eaten a mouthful of betel that
was in the betel box, left the room without speaking, and went away
after closing the opening through which he had come.</p>
<p>The Princess arose at about eight, and having gone to bathe in the
water, when she looked at it saw that soap had been rubbed in the
water, and some one had washed in it. Then she went to the table on
which was the rice, and when she looked half the rice had been eaten.
So the Princess having returned without eating the rice, lay down and
thought, &ldquo;A much cleverer person than I, indeed, has done this
work. Except a deity, no man can come to the place where I am staying.
I shall seize that thief to-morrow.&rdquo; Having thought that, she
went to sleep.</p>
<p>The Prince having come away, and having been asleep in the
travellers&rsquo; shed, in the day-time went to the old woman and ate.
Then having returned to the tunnel and slept there, he went that night
also, and washed in the water and ate, and came away. That night, also,
the Princess being asleep was unable to seize him.</p>
<p>The Prince came back, and having slept that night, also,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>at the travellers&rsquo; shed, in the day time
asked the old woman for rice and ate it. Then he returned to the
tunnel, and after sleeping in it, at about twelve went and washed in
the water, and ate the rice. After eating betel he came away. The
Princess being asleep on that night also, was unable to seize him.</p>
<p>After that, what does the Princess do? At night, pricking her finger
with a needle, and rubbing lime-juice in the place, she remained awake
blowing it [on account of the smarting]. That night, also, the Prince
went. The Princess having seen the Prince enter, took a sword in her
hand, after awaking as though she had been asleep. Having seen that the
figure of the Prince was beautiful, and being pleased with it, she
closed her eyelids, pretending to be asleep.</p>
<p>The Prince knew very well that the Princess was awake. Now, as on
other nights, he went looking on the ground, and having soaped himself,
washed himself in the water. Then having come to the table, he ate the
rice. While he was eating it, the Princess, taking the sword, arose,
and having come towards him, asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;I am she whom they call the Glass
Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince also said, &ldquo;I am he whom they call the
youngest Prince of the King of such and such a city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Prince and Princess ate the food, and having talked
much, the Princess asked, &ldquo;For what purpose have you
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince replied, &ldquo;I have not come for anything else but to
take you away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;Our hiding and going off would not be
proper. Here, put away this jewelled ring and lock of hair. To-morrow
morning, having gone to our father the King, say, &lsquo;I have come to
marry your Princess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then saying, &lsquo;It is good,&rsquo; he will boil a
cauldron of water and give you it, and tell you to bathe in it. And he
will show you an iron tree, and tell you to saw it. When he has given
you the water, put this jewelled ring in the water and bathe; it will
be like cold water. When he has shown you <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>the iron tree, pull this
lock of hair across it; then it will saw it in two. After that, we two
having been married, let us go to your city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then taking the ring and the lock of hair, the Prince went back to
the travellers&rsquo; shed.</p>
<p>Next day, the Prince in the very manner the Princess told him, came
and spoke to the King. The King said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and
gave him those two tasks. The Prince performed both the tasks.</p>
<p>After that, the King, being pleased, publicly notified the
celebration of their marriage, and said, &ldquo;If you wish to live
here, stay here; if you wish to go, summon the Princess [to accompany
you] and go.&rdquo; Afterwards, having performed the marriage ceremony,
he called the Princess, and went to the place where that Cobra was
staying.</p>
<p>There she applied the medicine to the Cobra&rsquo;s ulcer, and it
healed. The Cobra, being pleased, gave the two persons a hidden
treasure consisting of gold, silver, pearls, and gems. After that, they
went to the Prince&rsquo;s city.</p>
<p>Thus, by bringing this Princess the Prince had two Princesses. The
King, the Prince&rsquo;s father, was pleased because the Prince who
went as the offering and the Princess had got married, and had
returned. Having eaten the marriage feast they remained there.</p>
<p>When those six elder brothers looked they saw that their Princesses
were not so beautiful as the Glass Princess. Because of it, the six
persons spoke together about killing the youngest Prince and taking the
Glass Princess; and they tried to kill the Prince. The Glass Princess,
knowing of it, told that Prince, and the two Princesses and the Prince
set off to go to another King.</p>
<p>While they were going in the midst of a forest, the <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e2190" title="Source: Vaedda">Vaedd&#257;</span> King
who dwelt in that forest saw this Glass Princess. In order to take
possession of the Princess, he seized the three persons, and having put
them in a house, prepared to kill the Prince.</p>
<p>So the Glass Princess, knowing this, became a mare, and placing the
Prince on her back, and telling the other Princess to hang by her tail,
went through the sky, and descended <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65"
href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>near another city. Having gone
to the city and taken labourers, they engaged in rice cultivation. When
they had been there a little while the King of the city died.</p>
<p>After his death they decorated the royal tusk elephant, and set off
with it in search of a new King. While they were going along taking it
through the streets, the elephant went and knelt near this Prince. Then
all the men having made obeisance, and caused the Prince to bathe,
placing the Prince and the two Queens on the back of the elephant, went
and stopped at the palace, and he became King.</p>
<p>When he had been ruling a little time, there was no rain at the city
of the King the Prince&rsquo;s father, and that country became
abandoned. Those six Princes and their six Queens, and his father the
King, and his mother, all these persons, being reduced to poverty, came
to an almshouse which this King had established, bringing firewood to
sell.</p>
<p>There this King having seen them, recognising them, came back after
summoning his father the King, and his mother, to the palace. He told
them, &ldquo;Because those six elder brothers and their six Queens
tried to kill me in order that my elder brothers might seize and carry
off the Glass Princess, I came away from the city, and was seized by a
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2203" title=
"Source: Vaedda">Vaedd&#257;</span> King, but I escaped and came
here.&rdquo; Then saying, &ldquo;There is the place where I was
cultivating rice. Go there, and cultivate rice and eat,&rdquo; he sent
the brothers to that place. Having sent them, he gave them this advice:
&ldquo;For the crime that you tried to commit by killing me, that has
befallen you. Therefore behave well now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, his father the King, his mother the Queen, the King and
the two Queens, those five persons, remained at the palace.</p>

of Mathur&#257;pur&#299; and Vijayanagaram caused the portraits of
their respective son and daughter to be painted, and sent envoys with
them in search of royal persons resembling them. The envoys met at a
river, exchanged pictures there, and returned to their masters, who
were satisfied with the portraits, and caused the wedding of the Prince
and Princess to be celebrated at the latter&rsquo;s home,
Vijayanagaram.</p>
<p>In the same work, p. 12, a Prince in the form of a parrot, which was
confined in a cage in the sleeping apartment of a Princess, on two
successive nights resumed his human form, and smeared sandal and scent
over the Princess while she slept, and then became a parrot once more.
On the third night she was awake, and he told her his history.</p>
<p>At page 103, also, the King of Udayagiri, father of a Prince who had
run off when about to be beheaded, having been deprived of his kingdom
by the King of the O&#7789;&#7789;a country, was reduced to selling
firewood for a living, together with his wife and six sons. They came

when he came. On the next night she scratched her finger with a needle

<h2 class="main">The Frog Prince</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a city there is a certain King; a widow lives at a
house near his palace. She subsists by going to this royal palace and
pounding rice there; having handed it over she takes away the rice
powder and lives on it.</p>
<p>During the time while she was getting a living in this way she bore
a frog, which she reared there. When it was grown up, the King of that
city caused this proclamation to be made by beat of tom-toms: &ldquo;I
will give half my kingdom, and goods amounting to an elephant&rsquo;s
load, to the person who brings the Jewelled Golden Cock<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2283src" href="#xd26e2283" name="xd26e2283src">1</a>
that is at the house of the R&#257;kshas&#299; (Ogress).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every one said of it that it could not be done. The widow&rsquo;s
Frog having heard the King&rsquo;s proclamation, said to the widow,
&ldquo;Mother, I will bring the Jewelled Golden Cock. Cook a bundle of
rice and give me it.&rdquo; Having heard the Frog&rsquo;s words, the
widow cooked a bundle of rice and gave it to him.</p>
<p>The Frog took the bundle of rice, and hanging it from his shoulder
went to an Indi (wild Date) tree, scraped the leaf off a Date spike
(the mid-rib of the leaf), and strung the rice on it. While going away
after stringing it, the Frog then became like a very good-looking royal
Prince, and a horse and clothing for him made their appearance there.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>Putting on the clothes he mounted the horse, and
making it bound along he went on till he came to a city.</p>
<p>Hearing that he had arrived, the King of that city prepared quarters
for this Prince to stay at, and having given him ample food and drink,
asked, &ldquo;Where art thou going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said: &ldquo;The King of our city has made a
proclamation by beat of tom-toms, that he will give half his kingdom
and an elephant&rsquo;s load of gold to the person who brings him the
Jewelled Golden Cock that is at the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s house.
Because of it I am going to fetch the Jewelled Golden Cock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King, being pleased with the Prince on account of it, gave him a
piece of charcoal. &ldquo;Should you be unable to escape from the
R&#257;kshas&#299; while returning after taking the Jewelled Golden
Cock, tell this piece of charcoal to be created a fire-fence, and cast
it down,&rdquo; he said. Taking it, he went to another city.</p>
<p>The King of that city in that very manner having prepared quarters,
and made ready and given him food and drink, asked, &ldquo;Where art
thou going?&rdquo; The Prince replied in the same words, &ldquo;I am
going to bring the Jewelled Golden Cock that is at the house of the
R&#257;kshas&#299;.&rdquo; That King also being pleased on account of
it gave him a stone, &ldquo;Should you be unable to escape from the
R&#257;kshas&#299;, tell this stone to be created a mountain, and cast
it down,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Taking the charcoal and the stone which those two Kings gave him, he
went to yet another city. The King also in that very manner having
given him quarters, and food and drink, asked, &ldquo;Where art thou
going?&rdquo; The Prince in that very way said, &ldquo;I am going to
bring the Jewelled Golden Cock.&rdquo; That King also being greatly
pleased gave him a thorn. &ldquo;Should you be unable to escape from
the R&#257;kshas&#299;, tell a thorn fence to be created, and cast down
this thorn,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>On the next day he went to the house of the R&#257;kshas&#299;. She
was not at home; the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s daughter was there.
That girl having seen the Prince coming and not knowing him, asked,
&ldquo;Elder brother, elder brother, where are you going?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;Younger sister, I am not going anywhere
whatever. I came to beg at your hands the Jewelled Golden Cock which
you have got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To that she replied, &ldquo;Elder brother, to-day indeed I am unable
to give it. To-morrow I can. Should my mother come now she will eat
you; for that reason come and hide yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calling him into the house, she put him in a large trunk at the
bottom of seven trunks, and shut him up in it.</p>
<p>After a little time had passed, the R&#257;kshas&#299; came back.
Having come and seen that the Prince&rsquo;s horse was there, she asked
her daughter, &ldquo;Whose is this horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s daughter replied,
&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s whatever. It came out of the jungle, and I caught
it to ride on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshas&#299; having said, &ldquo;If so, it is good,&rdquo;
came in. While lying down to sleep at night the sweet odour of the
Prince having reached the R&#257;kshas&#299;, she said to her daughter,
&ldquo;What is this, Bola?<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2339src" href=
"#xd26e2339" name="xd26e2339src">2</a> A smell of a fresh human body is
coming to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s daughter said, &ldquo;What,
mother! Do you say so? You are constantly eating fresh bodies; how can
there not be an odour of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the R&#257;kshas&#299;, taking those words for the
truth, went to sleep.</p>
<p>At dawn on the following day, as soon as she arose the
R&#257;kshas&#299; went to seek human flesh for food. After she had
gone, the R&#257;kshasa-daughter, taking out the Prince who was shut up
in the box, told that Prince a device on going away with the Jewelled
Golden Cock: &ldquo;Elder brother, if you are going away with the Cock,
take some cords and fasten them round my shoulders. Having put them
round me, take the Cock, and having mounted the horse go off, making
him bound quickly. When you have gone I shall cry out. Mother comes
when I give three calls. After she has come, loosening me will occupy
much time; then you will be able to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the way she said, the Prince tied the R&#257;kshasa-daughter,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>and taking the Jewelled Golden Cock mounted the
horse, and making it bound quickly came away.</p>
<p>As that R&#257;kshasa-daughter said, while she was calling out the
R&#257;kshas&#299; came. Having come, after she looked about [she found
that] the R&#257;kshasa-daughter was tied, and the Jewelled Golden Cock
had been taken away. After she had asked, &ldquo;Who was it? Who took
it?&rdquo; the R&#257;kshasa-daughter said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
who it was.&rdquo; After that, she very quickly unfastened the
R&#257;kshasa-daughter, and both of them came running to eat that
Prince.</p>
<p>The Prince was unable to go quickly. While going, the Prince turned
round, and on looking back saw that this R&#257;kshas&#299; and the
R&#257;kshasa-daughter were coming running to eat that Prince.</p>
<p>After that, he cast down the thorn which the above-mentioned King of
the third city gave him, having told a thorn fence to be created. A
thorn fence was created. Having jumped over it they came on.</p>
<p>After that, when he had put down the piece of stone which the King
of the second city gave him, and told a mountain to be created, a
mountain was created. They sprang over that mountain also, and came
on.</p>
<p>After that, he cast down the charcoal which the King of the first
city gave him, having told a fire fence to be created. In that very
manner a fire fence was created. Having come to it, while jumping over
it both of them were burnt and died.</p>
<p>From that place the Prince came along. While coming, he arrived at
the Indi tree on which he had threaded the rice, and having taken off
it all that dried-up rice he began to eat it. On coming to the end of
it, the person who was like that Prince again became a Frog.</p>
<p>After he became a Frog, the clothes that he was wearing, and the
horse, and the Jewelled Golden Cock vanished. Out of grief on that
account that Frog died at that very place.</p>

heaven. He seems to have been a turtle and not a tortoise, being
described as swimming for weeks across the Seven Seas. He climbed
Udayagiri, the Mountain of the Dawn, and blocked the way of the Sun-god
(who rises from behind it), in honour of whom he uttered 1,008 praises.
Pleased with this, the deity gave him a splendid divine body like a
man&rsquo;s, and the power to resume his tortoise shape at will; he
directed him to a sage, who sent him to another, and this one to a
third, by whose advice he secured the love and assistance of a divine

invite to the wedding. When he threw down the earth a mountain was
produced behind him; the water became a great river; the thorns a dense
thorny wood. When the R&#257;kshasa emerged from the wood and was
coming on, the Prince threw down the fire, which set the bushes and
trees in front of him ablaze, and finding this difficult to cross he

<p>Having gone to a village, he went along asking the way to a house

remained in a shed at the house. A lucky hour had been fixed by
astrology for cutting the hair [for the first time] of a child at the
house, on the following day after that.</p>
<p>Having told at the hand of his wife to put rice in water [to clean
it], and to cook cakes from it, the man of the house that evening went
to the watch-hut in his chena. The woman having pounded the rice and
cooked cakes, selected the best cakes and put them in the rice mortar

remained there looking on.</p>
<p>Afterwards the man who went to the watch hut returned, and when he

that millet trader.&rdquo; Then the woman having selected burnt, very
burnt ones, and given them to the millet trader, the trader saying,
&ldquo;I cannot bite these,&rdquo; put the cakes on the others in the
rice mortar, and pounded them. The woman scowled at the millet trader,

"pb73">73</a>]</span>so she remained silent. The millet trader, having
pounded all the cakes and eaten, tied up the surplus ones and put them
aside.</p>
<p>After that, the man went again to the watch hut. Then that woman
quickly put a gill of rice in water, and having pounded it into flour
and very hurriedly cooked cakes, placed them in the house, and lay down
in it.</p>
<p>The millet trader awoke, and while he was there looking about, saw a
man coming. Arising quickly, he came to the open space in front of the
house and coughed. Then the man, thinking<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2434" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Perhaps the man is at
the house,&rdquo; went back again.</p>
<p>After that, the millet trader went inside the house. That woman
taking those cakes gave them in the dark to the millet trader, and
said, &ldquo;And&#333;! When I was cooking cakes I put the best cakes
in the rice mortar in order to give them to you. Then, after being in
the watch hut he (the husband) came, and while eating the cakes said to
me, &lsquo;Give a couple of cakes to that millet trader&rsquo;; so I
gave them. After that, the millet trader, that Ro&#7693;iy&#257;,
having put the cakes in the rice mortar that was full of the best
cakes, pounded them and ate. Then I again put a gill of rice into
water, and pounded it into flour, saying that you will come; and only
just now finished cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The millet trader said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is good,&rdquo; and
ate.</p>
<p>Afterwards the woman said, &ldquo;Now then, are we not cutting the
child&rsquo;s hair to-morrow? Now, what will you give on account of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The millet trader said, &ldquo;What have I got to give? When coming
for millet I only brought four tuttu.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2446src" href="#xd26e2446" name="xd26e2446src">2</a></p>
<p>Then the woman, saying, &ldquo;Be off! Be off! Ro&#7693;iy&#257;!
Are you the millet trader, Bola?&rdquo; drove him away.</p>
<p>When he had gone back to the shed, she again put a gill of rice in
water, and having pounded it and very rapidly cooked cakes and brought
them into the house, lay down.</p>
<p>Afterwards, while the millet trader was there looking about, he
again saw that man coming, so he arose quickly, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>and came
to the open space in front of the house and coughed. That man again
went away.</p>
<p>After that, the millet trader went into the house again. That woman
rose quickly, and gave those cakes to him, and said to the man,
&ldquo;And&#333;! When I was cooking cakes to give to you I put the
best cakes in the rice mortar. Afterwards he came from the watch hut,
and while eating the cakes said to me, &lsquo;Give a couple of cakes to
that millet trader.&rsquo; So I gave them. Afterwards that
Ro&#7693;iy&#257;, putting the cakes in the rice mortar which was full
of the best cakes, pounded them and ate. Then I again put a gill of
rice in water, and cooked more cakes. Then, while I was looking out for
you, some one like you came in the dark. I gave them to him. While he
was eating them I said, &lsquo;Now then, are we not cutting the
child&rsquo;s hair to-morrow? What will you give?&rsquo; That
Ro&#7693;iy&#257; said, &lsquo;Only the four tuttu that I brought for
millet.&rsquo; Then I got to know who it was. I drove him away, and
again put a gill of rice in water, and pounded it, and I have only just
finished cooking more cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The millet trader, saying, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is good,&rdquo; ate
the cakes.</p>
<p>Then the woman said, &ldquo;Now then, are we not cutting the
child&rsquo;s hair to-morrow? What will you give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The millet trader said, &ldquo;If you should ask me even another
time, still the same four tuttu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman saying, &ldquo;Be off! Be off! Millet trader,
Ro&#7693;iy&#257;! Hast come again, thou!&rdquo; drove him away. Then
it became light.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the man who went to the watch hut came, and handed over
the millet to the millet trader. On his giving it, the millet trader,
tying it up in two bundles and placing them on his head, set off to go
into the house.</p>
<p>That man saw it, and asked, &ldquo;Where are you going
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The millet trader replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. During the
whole of last night they were going and coming along this very way, so
I thought, &lsquo;Maybe this is a high road.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;Put down the packages of millet there,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>and having gone to the millet store-room, and
handed over a greater quantity from the millet in it, beat that
woman.</p>
<p>From there the millet trader went to another village, and sitting
down at a house unfastened that package of pounded cakes, and was
eating them. A woman who was looking on said, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;!
What are you eating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trader said, &ldquo;They are pounded cakes of our
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman saying, &ldquo;The colour of them is good indeed; give me
some to look at,&rdquo; begged and got some.</p>
<p>After eating them she said, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! These millet
cakes have a sweet taste; they are indeed good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trader replied, &ldquo;In our quarter the millet is of that very
sort; let us go there together if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said<span class="corr" id="xd26e2490" title=
"Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;H&#257;&rdquo; and having taken out all
the effects in the house placed them in the jungle, ready for taking
when she went.</p>
<p>Afterwards, taking those things, as they were getting very far away
the man said, &ldquo;What have you forgotten? Consider well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman replied, &ldquo;I have not forgotten anything. I only
forgot my flowered hair comb. It is of the pattern of my flowered hair
pin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trader said, &ldquo;To be without a flowered hair comb is not
proper in my country. I shall be here; you go and fetch it. If I should
not be here on your return, call me, saying,
&lsquo;Day-before-Yesterday! Day-before-Yesterday!&rsquo; My name is
Day-before-Yesterday (<i lang=
"si-latn">Per&#275;d&#257;</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman came running home. When she returned, taking the
flowered hair comb, the man was not there. So saying,
&ldquo;Day-before-Yesterday! Day-before-Yesterday!&rdquo; the woman
called and called. The man was not there.</p>
<p>The woman returned home, weeping and weeping. While she was there,
her husband, having gone somewhere or other, came back, and asked,
&ldquo;What are you crying for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;He who was taking millet,
Day-before-Yesterday, plundered the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;If he plundered the house day before yesterday,
why didst thou not tell me yesterday?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>The woman replied, &ldquo;Not day before yesterday. He who was
taking millet, Day-before-Yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that just what I&rsquo;m
saying? When he plundered the house day before yesterday, why didst
thou not tell me yesterday?&rdquo; Having said this, he beat the
woman.</p>
<p>When the millet trader, taking the effects and the bundles of
millet, went from there carrying his load, he came to another village.
On going to a house, a woman was there weeping and weeping.</p>
<p>As the man was placing the effects and the millet bundles on the
veranda of the house, he said, &ldquo;App&#275;! I have been to the
other world and back,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2520src" href=
"#xd26e2520" name="xd26e2520src">3</a> and laying them on the veranda,
said, &ldquo;What are you crying for, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;My daughter died six days ago. When I think
of her I am weeping.&rdquo; Then she asked the millet trader,
&ldquo;An&#275;! My Latt&#299; went to the other world; did you meet
her there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The millet trader said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, mother. I did meet
her there. She is now in the other world. I have taken in marriage that
very Latt&#299;. I have come for Latt&#299;&rsquo;s things that she
puts on her arms and neck. She told me to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman quickly arose, and having cooked abundantly for the
trader, and given him to eat, he said, &ldquo;Mother, I must go
immediately. Where is father-in-law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went to plough; wait till he comes,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is our wedding feast
to-morrow. I must be off now to go to the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she gave the trader the silver and golden things for placing on
her daughter&rsquo;s arms and neck, also. Then the trader taking the
bundles of millet, the effects, and the things for the arms and neck,
went away.</p>
<p>After that, when the woman&rsquo;s husband who had gone to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>plough came, the woman was laughing. Seeing it, he
asked, &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman replied, &ldquo;Bolan, why shouldn&rsquo;t I laugh? Our
son-in-law came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What son-in-law?&rdquo; the man asked.</p>
<p>The woman said over and over again, &ldquo;Latt&#299;&rsquo;s man
came, Latt&#299;&rsquo;s man came. Our son-in-law, to whom our daughter
is given in the other world. It is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man asked, &ldquo;Bola, can any one in the other world come to
this world? Didst thou cook and also give him to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman replied, &ldquo;What! Didn&rsquo;t I cook and give him to
eat! After I had given him to eat he said that Latt&#299; had told him
to take away the things for her arms and neck. So I gave him those
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man said, &ldquo;Where is now, Bola, the horse that was
here?&rdquo; and asking<span class="corr" id="xd26e2559" title=
"Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Which way did he go?&rdquo; and
mounting on the horse&rsquo;s back, went to seek that millet
trader.</p>
<p>As the trader was going along in the rice field he looked back, and
having seen a man coming on horseback, said, &ldquo;That one is coming
to seize me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a Timbiri tree very near there into which he climbed.
While he was there, that man making the horse bound along, having come
up, tied the horse to the root of the Timbiri tree. After he had
climbed up the tree to catch the trader, the trader, descending from
the ends of the Timbiri branches and cutting the fastening, mounted the
horse, after placing on it also the bundles of millet and the other
goods, and went off on the horse.</p>
<p>Then that man descended slowly from the tree, and having called
&ldquo;H&#363;&rdquo; to the millet trader [to arrest his attention],
said, &ldquo;Tell Latt&#299; that your mother-in-law gave you a few
things to put on her arms and neck, but your father-in-law gave you a
horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having returned to the house, he said to the woman, &ldquo;It is
true. He is really Latt&#299;&rsquo;s man. I said &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go
on foot,&rsquo; and having given him the horse I came back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it so indeed! I told you
so.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the millet trader having gone to his village, and divided the
goods with the chena cultivator, sowed the millet in the chena, and
remained there.</p>

<p class="first">The story about Latt&#299;&rsquo;s husband occurs in
<span class="bibl"><i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. i, p. 62</span>, the
dead girl&rsquo;s name being Kaluh&#257;m&#299;. Her father was a
Gamar&#257;la, and the man who carried off the things for her was a
beggar.</p>
<p>This part of the story is also given, with slight variations, in
<span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Sun</i>, Southern India (Kingscote
and Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), p. 135 ff.</span></p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Folklore in Southern India</i>
(Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), p. 131 ff.</span>, the rogue
did not pretend to be married to the woman&rsquo;s daughter, but
represented to her that her parents were living in the other world in a
very miserable state, without proper clothing, and without the means of
purchasing food. She handed over to him the clothing, jewels, and cash
in the house, and he went off at once with them. The ending of the
incident is the same as in Ceylon.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. xviii, p.
120</span>, there is a story from Southern India, by
Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;, in which a
youth obtained work under an app&#257;<a class="noteref" id=

Year.&rdquo; When he absconded with her cash-box she gave the alarm in
the village by saying, &ldquo;Last Year (he) stole and took my
box,&rdquo; and was thought to be out of her mind.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. ii, p.
182</span>, the incident of the cakes pounded in the mortar is related.
After eating part of the pounded cakes, the traveller was about to
enter the corn-store in which the woman had concealed her lover. On the
woman&rsquo;s stopping him, the husband&rsquo;s suspicions being
aroused he examined the corn-store, and finding the man in it, beat him
well, and his own wife also. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city there are two Princes, it is said. A
flower-mother<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2627src" href="#xd26e2627"
name="xd26e2627src">1</a> cooks and gives food to the two Princes. The
mother of the Princes is dead; the father is alive. The King has
married another Queen, and because the Queen is not good to the Princes
they live with the flower-mother.</p>
<p>One day, while they were living in that manner, the two Princes
having gone to shoot birds with bows and arrows, walked until
night-fall, but were unable to find any birds. As they were coming
back, there was a Horse-radish tree (<i lang=
"si-latn">Murung&#257;</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2635src" href=
"#xd26e2635" name="xd26e2635src">2</a> at the front of the King&rsquo;s
palace, in which was a turtle dove. The younger brother saw it, and
said to the elder brother, &ldquo;Elder brother, there! There is a
turtle-dove.&rdquo; The elder brother shot at the turtle-dove, and it
fell dead.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the younger brother having picked it up and come back,
said at the hand of the elder brother<span class="corr" id="xd26e2641"
title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Elder brother, are we to give
this to our father the King, or are we to give it to the
flower-mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the elder brother said, &ldquo;Why should we give it to our
father the King? We will give it to the flower-mother who gives us food
and clothing.&rdquo; Taking the turtle-dove, the two Princes came to
the house of the flower-mother, and gave it into the
flower-mother&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>On that day the King was not at the palace; only the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>Queen
was there. The Queen remained listening to all that the two Princes
said, and stayed looking [to see] if they gave the turtle-dove into the
hand of the flower-mother.</p>
<p>That being so, after the King&rsquo;s return to the palace in the
evening the Queen told at the hand of the King what the Princes said,
and the fact that they gave the turtle-dove into the hand of the
flower-mother.</p>
<p>After that, the King settled to behead both Princes on the morrow.
The flower-mother on hearing of it said at the hand of the Princes,
&ldquo;Children, the King said that he must behead you two to-morrow.
To save both your lives go away somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having cooked a bundle of rice in the night, she placed gem-stones
at the bottom of the bag and the cooked rice above them; and having
tied up the bag she gave it into the hands of the Princes before it
became light, and told them to go.</p>
<p>The two Princes took the bundle of cooked rice and went away. Having
gone on and on, being hungry they sat down in the shade of a great
forest. For rinsing their mouths after chewing betel, before eating
rice, there was no water.</p>
<p>While they were seated there, a turtle-dove came and fell down,
making a noise, &ldquo;tas,&rdquo; as it struck the ground. The younger
brother asked, &ldquo;Elder brother, what shall we do with this
turtle-dove?&rdquo; Then the elder brother said, &ldquo;Hide it in a
heap of leaves, for us to eat it yet.&rdquo; The younger brother hid
it.</p>
<p>Thereupon a Vaedd&#257; came, and asked at the hand of the two
brothers, &ldquo;An&#275;! Didn&rsquo;t a turtle-dove fall
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Princes said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Vaedd&#257; sought for it, continuing to say,
&ldquo;An&#275;! After trying for seven years, I shot the turtle-dove
with my bow and arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princes said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Vaedi-elder-brother, why is
the turtle-dove such a good one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vaedd&#257; replied, &ldquo;Why <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2671" title="Source: should&rsquo;nt">shouldn&rsquo;t</span> it
be good? The person who has eaten the right portion at that very time
will receive the sovereignty. The person who has eaten <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>the left
portion will receive the sovereignty after seven years have gone
by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said thus, the Vaedd&#257; sought and sought it; he was
unable to find the turtle-dove, and he went away. Then, having cooked
it, the elder Prince ate the right half; the younger Prince ate the
left half.</p>
<p>Having eaten it, the elder Prince, taking the small copper water-pot
which the flower-mother gave them, went to seek for water. The younger
brother remained there.</p>
<p>The elder brother, breaking and throwing down branches all along the
path, having gone on and on, came to a large stream. Hearing a beating
of tom-toms while getting water in the pot, he stayed there, looking
[to see] what it was about. While he was there, the tom-toming having
come near him, a tusk elephant came close to the Prince and knelt
down.</p>
<p>The Prince knew that the royal elephant had selected him for the
sovereignty, and said, &ldquo;An&#275;! A younger brother of mine is
there; how can I go without him? I will go there and come with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the men who were there said, &ldquo;You cannot seek your
younger brother; you must mount now.&rdquo; Afterwards the Prince
having mounted on the elephant, went to the city of that kingdom, and
became the king.</p>
<p>The younger brother, after having looked and looked for a long time,
taking the bundle of cooked rice, came along the path on which the
branches were broken, and descended to the stream. Then, having seen
the elephant&rsquo;s footprints, continuing to say, &ldquo;An&#275;! It
is this very elephant that has killed elder brother,&rdquo; weeping and
weeping he drank water; and having eaten part of the cooked rice, tied
up the other part and went away.</p>
<p>While going along the path on which were the elephant&rsquo;s
footprints, he saw that his Prince&rsquo;s robes were torn and torn,
and repeating, &ldquo;An&#275;! Elder brother has been killed. It is
this very elephant. Kill me also, O Gods,&rdquo; weeping and weeping,
going on and on, he went after nightfall to a
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s house at some city or other, and said,
&ldquo;An&#275;! You must give me a resting-place for the night.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>The He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; was not at home; only his wife was
there. The woman said to the Prince, &ldquo;No resting-place will be
given here. We do not allow any one to come to our house. The
He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la goes to the King, to fan his face. On that
account the He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la does not permit any one to come
to this house. To-day the He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la went to the King,
to fan his face. He will come at this time. Before he comes go away
quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said<span class="corr" id="xd26e2696" title=
"Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;An&#275;! Don&rsquo;t say so. There is
not a quarter to which I can go now. In some way or other you must give
me it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman, taking a bit of mat, gave it into the Prince&rsquo;s
hand, saying, &ldquo;If so, go to that calf house. When the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; comes don&rsquo;t even cough or anything. You
must be silent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the Prince was sitting in the calf house, the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; returned, and while he was eating rice a cough
came to the Prince. The Prince tried and tried to be silent. He could
not. He coughed.</p>
<p>The He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; having heard it said to his wife,
&ldquo;What is that, Bola, I hear there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;An&#275;! A youth, not vicious nor low, came
and asked for a resting-place. I told him to go to the calf house. Do
nothing to him. I told him to get up before daylight and go
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, saying, &ldquo;I told thee,
&lsquo;Do not give a resting-place to any one&rsquo;; is it not so? Why
didst thou give it?&rdquo; beat the woman. Having finished eating rice
he came into the raised veranda.</p>
<p>When he was there, that Prince took the remains of his rice, and
while eating it and thinking in his mind, &ldquo;An&#275;! Was I not
indeed a royal Prince before; why must I stop now in a calf
house?&rdquo; he saw the gem-stones at the bottom of the rice, and
placing one on his knee ate the rice by its light.</p>
<p>The He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; having seen the light, asked at the
hand of the woman, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Did you go and give a light
also to that one?&rdquo; The woman said, &ldquo;It is not a light that
I took and gave him.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=
"#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; got up and went to look, and
having seen the gem-stone, scolded the woman. &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;!
When my friend from a foreign town came dost thou give him a
resting-place in this way? What hast thou given it at the calf house
for? Was there no better place to give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, and again beaten the woman, &ldquo;Quickly warm
water,&rdquo; he said. After waiting while she was warming it, he took
the water into the house, and having placed it there, said to the
Prince, &ldquo;Let us go, younger brother, to bathe,&rdquo; and gave
him a bath. After finishing bathing him, having cooked food abundantly
and laid the table, he gave him to eat.</p>
<p>When that was finished, he prepared a bed for sleeping, and said,
&ldquo;Younger brother, come and sleep.&rdquo; The Prince came.
Afterwards the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; said to the Prince,
&ldquo;Younger brother, if there are any things of value in your hands
give them into my hands. I will return them to you at the time when you
ask for them. If they be kept in your hands they may be lost. There are
thieves hereabouts; we cannot get rid of them. They will not let us
keep anything; they carry it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said<span class="corr" id="xd26e2723" title=
"Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;An&#275;! There is nothing in my
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; said, &ldquo;Nay, there was a gem-stone
in your hand; I saw it. It will be there yet; give me it. I shall not
take it in that way. I will give you it at the time when you ask for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;An&#275;! He&#7789;&#7789;i-elder-brother, I
know your He&#7789;&#7789;i slumber. It is necessary for me to arise
early, while it is still night, and go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; said, &ldquo;I shall give you it
when you ask for it, no matter if I should be asleep. You can awake me;
then I will give it.&rdquo; Having said thus and thus, the Prince gave
all the gem-stones into the hands of the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;. The
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; taking them and placing them in a house in the
middle of seven houses, went to sleep.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Prince having been asleep, arose while it was still
night, and awoke the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, saying, &ldquo;An&#275;!
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>He&#7789;&#7789;i-elder-brother, it is necessary
for me to go expeditiously. Quickly give me those few
gem-stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, in this manner he asks and asks. It is no affair of the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s. Then the woman said, &ldquo;What is
this! One cannot exist for this troubling. Must not persons who took a
thing give it back? Must not this youth who is not vicious nor low go
away? Why are you keeping them back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, having got up, opening the
seven doors of the seven houses came out into the light, and saying,
&ldquo;When, Bola, did I get gem-stones from thee?&rdquo; he cut off
the hair-knot of the Prince, and took him for his slave. So the Prince
remained there, continuing to do slave work for the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;.</p>
<p>Afterwards, one day the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; and the Prince
having gone on a journey somewhere, as they were coming to a stream the
seven Princesses of the King of that country having been bathing in the
stream, saw the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; and the Prince going on the
road.</p>
<p>The youngest Princess said to the other Princesses, &ldquo;Elder
sisters, that one going there is indeed a Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The six Princesses said, &ldquo;So indeed! The
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s slave has become a Prince to
thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess said another time, &ldquo;However much you should
say it is not so, that is indeed a Prince going along there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The six Princesses said, &ldquo;It is not merely that to thee the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s slave has become a Prince; he will
come to call thee [to be his wife].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess replied still another time, &ldquo;It is really
so; he is inviting me indeed. However much you should say that, it was
really a Prince who went there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The six Princesses said, &ldquo;If he is inviting thee go thou also.
The He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s slave is going there; go thou
before he departs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess replied, &ldquo;I shall really go. You look. What
though I have not gone now! Shall I not go hereafter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the seven Princesses had come to the palace, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>youngest
Princess said at the hand of her father the King, &ldquo;When we were
bathing now, a slave youth went along with the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;. That slave youth is really a
Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King sent an order to the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; that the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s slave and the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;
should come to him. Afterwards the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; and the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s slave went to the King.</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;Whence this slave youth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then before the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; said anything the Prince
replied, &ldquo;I was formerly a royal Prince; now I am doing slave
work for this He&#7789;&#7789;i-elder-brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King asked at the hand of the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;,
&ldquo;Is he doing slave work for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King decided that he would give his youngest
daughter to the slave youth (as his wife), so he sent away the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, and the Princess with the slave youth.</p>
<p>As those three were going to the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s
house, the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, becoming hungry while on the way,
gave money into the hand of the Prince, and said, &ldquo;With this
money get three gills of rice, and with these ten sallis (half
farthings) get a sun-dried fish, and come back and cook them.&rdquo; He
gave money for it separately into the Prince&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The Prince having bought three gills of rice with the money given
for it, and placed it on the hearth to boil, took the ten sallis and
went to the shops for the dried fish. When he looked at the dried fish
there was none to get for ten sallis.</p>
<p>As he was coming back bringing the ten sallis, a man was on the
road, having laid down a heap of dried fish. When the Prince came there
the man asked him, &ldquo;Where, younger brother, are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I came for a dried fish; I have ten sallis.
There being no dried fish to get for ten sallis I am going
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man said, &ldquo;Give me the ten sallis. Take any dried
fish you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Prince having given the ten sallis to the trader,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>selected a large dried fish, and putting it on his
shoulder, as he was coming near the river the dried fish was laughing.
After laughing, it asked, &ldquo;Are you taking me in this manner to
cook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince replied, &ldquo;Yes, to cook indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dried fish said, &ldquo;Do not take me. You are going to die
now. From that I will deliver you. Put me into the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince having placed the dried fish in the river, and come back
&ldquo;simply&rdquo; (that is, without it), made sauce and cooked the
rice. When he had finished, the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; said,
&ldquo;Separate and give me the cooked rice boiled from two
gills.&rdquo; So the Prince separated the rice from two gills and gave
it. Then the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; asked, &ldquo;Where is the dried
fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I could not get a dried fish for ten sallis;
I walked through the whole of the bazaar. I came back empty-handed
(&lsquo;simply&rsquo;).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; having eaten half the rice
in silence, heaped up the other half in the direction of the Princess
(thus inviting her to eat it). The Princess saying, &ldquo;Go thou!
Have I come to eat rice out of the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s
bowl?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2799src" href="#xd26e2799"
name="xd26e2799src">3</a> went to the place where the Prince was
eating, and ate rice from the Prince&rsquo;s plate.</p>
<p>Then the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; said, &ldquo;If it is wrong for
thee to eat from my bowl, how is it thou art eating from my
slave&rsquo;s bowl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, shouldst thou
any day say &lsquo;slave&rsquo; again, I will tell it at the hand of my
father the King, and get thee quartered and hung at the city
gates.&rdquo; After that the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; was silent.</p>
<p>The whole three having finished eating rice, went on board the
vessel that was to carry them along the river. While going along in the
vessel, the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; said to the Prince, &ldquo;Cut me
a mouthful of betel and areka-nut, and give me it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;Now then, having already cut betel and
areka-nut, his food is done.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87"
href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Prince saying, &ldquo;It is not wrong; I will cut and give
it,&rdquo; cut and gave it to the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;.</p>
<p>Afterwards the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; again said to the Prince,
&ldquo;Get a little water and give me it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess saying, &ldquo;Now then, your doing slave work is
stopped,&rdquo; told the Prince not to give it.</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;When there is thirst, how can one not give
water? I will give him a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was bending down over the side of the vessel to get the
water, the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; raised him, and threw him into the
river.</p>
<p>As the Prince fell into the river, the dried fish that he had
previously put in the river took him on its back, and having brought
him to the shore, left him there. The He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; and the
Princess went on in the ship to the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>The Prince was in the sun, on a sandbank. Then, as a flower-mother
was coming to the river for water, she saw the Prince, and said,
&ldquo;What is this, son, that you are in the sun? Come away and go
with me.&rdquo; Inviting him, and going to her house with him, she
warmed some water and made him bathe, and gave him food.</p>
<p>While he was there, the Prince told all at the hand of the
flower-mother. After telling it, when he said, &ldquo;I must go again
to the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; the flower mother
said, &ldquo;O son, let him do what he likes. Don&rsquo;t you go. Stop
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince replying, &ldquo;I cannot stay without going, O
flower-mother; I will go there and come back to you,&rdquo; went there.
After he had gone to the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s house he
found that men had collected together there, and were saying that the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; and the Princess were to be married on such
and such a day. He stayed listening to them, and went again to the
flower-mother&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>After he returned, asking for four sallis at the hand of the
flower-mother he went to the potters&rsquo; village, and giving them
the four sallis told them, &ldquo;When I come to-morrow you must have
ready a kettle having three zig-zag lines round it and twelve
spouts.&rdquo; So saying, he came back to the flower-mother&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>On the morning of the following day he walked to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>potters&rsquo; village, and taking the kettle,
came to the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;&rsquo;s house. As he arrived, men
were dancing, and the King was looking on. At the time when they were
finishing dancing he got on the raised veranda, and looked on. The
dancing being ended he came out to the wedding hall. Then the Princess
saw him and laughed. At that moment the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;
trembled.</p>
<p>The Prince having gone there said, &ldquo;Stop that. It is necessary
for me to dance a little.&rdquo; Then he began to tell them all from
the very beginning: &ldquo;We were of such and such a city, the sons of
the King of such and such a name. We were two Princes, an elder brother
and a younger brother. Our mother was dead. A flower-mother gave us
food and clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus said a little of the story that he was relating, he
danced, and while dancing sang to the kettle that he held in his
hand&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Possessing three bent lines, a dozen spouts as
well,</p>
<p class="line">Little kettle, hear this our trouble that
befel.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2845src" href="#xd26e2845" name=
"xd26e2845src">4</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then he said, &ldquo;While living thus we said one
day, &lsquo;Let us go and shoot birds,&rsquo; and elder brother and I
went. Having walked till night-fall we did not meet with a single one.
While we were returning home, as it was becoming night, there was a
Horse-radish tree in front of the palace of our father the King. In
that Horse-radish tree was a turtle-dove which elder brother shot; at
the stroke it fell dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards I asked at elder brother&rsquo;s hand regarding
it, &lsquo;Elder brother, to whom are we to give this?&rsquo; Then
elder brother said, &lsquo;There is no need to give it to our father
the King; let us give it to the flower-mother who gives us food and
clothing.&rsquo; So saying, we took it home and gave it to the
flower-mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he danced, and sang while dancing&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Possessing three bent lines, a dozen spouts as
well,</p>
<p class="line">Little kettle, hear this our trouble that befel.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Pu&ntilde;ci-Amm&#257; (step-mother, <i>lit.</i>
&lsquo;little mother&rsquo;) after hearing this, on the return of our
father the King told him of it, and our father the King appointed to
behead us. Afterwards our flower-mother to save the lives of us both
told us to go away. Having cooked a bundle of rice, and tied up a bag
of it, placing gem-stones at the bottom and the cooked rice above, she
gave it into the hand of both of us, and told us to go away somewhere
before it became light. So we both came away. Walking on and on, we
came to a great forest, and both of us sat down in the
shade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he danced again, and sang while dancing&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Possessing three bent lines, a dozen spouts as
well,</p>
<p class="line">Little kettle, hear this our trouble that befel.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">After that, he told a further part of his tale, and
then danced again. Thus, in that way he related all the things that had
occurred.</p>
<p>The King who had come to celebrate the wedding was the
Prince&rsquo;s elder brother. While the Prince was relating all these
things the King wept.</p>
<p>Then the King asked at the hand of the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;,
&ldquo;Is what he has said regarding the gem-stones, and the taking him
as a slave, true?&rdquo; The He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; replied,
&ldquo;It is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King caused the He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; to be quartered,
and hung at the four gateways of the city.</p>
<p>After the King had caused the Prince and Princess to be married, and
had given that kingdom to the Prince, both the King and the Prince went
to their cities.</p>
<p>The elder brother who had eaten the right portion of the turtle-dove
shot by the Vaedd&#257;, at that very time obtained the sovereignty.
The younger brother having eaten the left portion, when seven years had
passed, on that day obtained the sovereignty.</p>
<p>So the Prince and Princess remained at their city.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The notion that the persons who ate two birds, or the
halves of one bird or of a fruit, would become Kings, or a King and his
minister, is found throughout India in folk-tales.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl">J&#257;taka stories No. 284 (vol. ii, p.
280)</span>, and <span class="bibl">No. 445 (vol. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>iv, p.
24)</span>, two cocks were overheard to say that whoever ate one would
get a thousand pieces of money, and the person who ate the other would
become King, Chief Queen or Commander-in-Chief, and Treasurer or
King&rsquo;s favourite cleric. The second one was selected and eaten,
with the corresponding result.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. ii, p.
150</span>, there is a story by Miss S. J. Goonetilleke, in which a
blind man, sitting under a tree, heard a R&#257;kshasa who was in the
tree saying to others that if the fruit of the tree were rubbed on the
eyes of a blind man he would recover his sight, and that a person who
ate the fruit on the top of the tree would become a King within seven
days. The man regained his sight in this way, and having also eaten the
fruit was selected as King by the royal elephant, which knelt before
him. The man who had blinded him married his Prime Minister&rsquo;s
daughter; and ascertaining how the King recovered his sight and
obtained his position, he got his wife to treat him in the same way and
leave him under a tree, where he died.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. xvii, p.
75</span>, there is a tale of two Princes who were ordered to be
blinded because of a false charge made by the Queen, their step-mother.
They escaped, and killed a Chakw&#257; (Sheldrake) which they heard
informing its mate that he who ate its head would become a King, and he
who ate the liver would be very happy after twelve years&rsquo;
wanderings. The elder brother went for food to a city, where the royal
elephant threw a garland over his neck, and he became King. The younger
brother being unable to find him worked for a potter, then travelled on
and took the place of a woman&rsquo;s son who was going to be offered
to an Ogre, who had forced a King to give him daily a cart-load of
sweet cakes, a couple of goats, and a young man. The Prince killed the
Ogre while he was eating the cakes. The King gave him his daughter in
marriage, and half the kingdom. The elder brother came to the wedding,
and they recognised each other. When they visited their father he sent
the Queen into exile.</p>
<p>In the Tamil work, <span class="bibl"><i>The Story of Madana
K&#257;ma R&#257;ja</i> (Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), p.
125 ff.</span>, a Mango tree growing in a thick forest bore a magical
fruit once in one hundred years. A sage waited for it, and went to
bathe in order to purify himself before eating it. As two Princes whose
parents had been reduced to poverty, were passing, the younger one
picked up the fruit and placed it in their packet of rice. The sage
followed them, but they denied all knowledge of the fruit. He informed
them that the person who ate the outer part would become a king, and
that from the mouth of the person who ate the seed, gems would drop
whenever he laughed. The brothers divided the fruit in this way, and a
royal elephant coming in search of a new King placed a garland on the
neck of the elder one, and depositing him on its back went off with
him. The younger one, thinking he was carried off by a wild elephant,
left the wood, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>and was received at the house of a dancing girl.
One day when he laughed gems fell from his mouth, and after getting
many more, they gave him a purgative pill and secured the magic stone.
After other adventures he was united to his brother, recovered the
mango stone, and became a King himself.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Wide-Awake Stories</i> (Steel and Temple),
p. 138 ff.</span>, <span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Punjab</i> (F. A.
Steel), p. 129</span>, two Princes ran away on account of their
step-mother&rsquo;s cruelty, and while resting under a tree heard a
Maina (Starling) and a Parrot telling each other that the two persons
who ate them would become a King and a Prime Minister. They shot the
birds with crossbows, and ate them. The younger one went back for the
other&rsquo;s whip, which was left at a spring, and was bitten and
killed by a snake. The elder was selected as King, by a royal elephant.
A magician found the dead Prince, drained the spring into his
wife&rsquo;s small brass pot, and the snakes being waterless gave back
the Prince&rsquo;s life. After stirring adventures, the younger Prince
married a Prime Minister&rsquo;s daughter, who went on a ship with him.
There he was thrown overboard, but caught a rope and got back to his
wife&rsquo;s cabin unobserved. He met his brother the King at last, and
was made to relate his life story. This he did in sections, on seven
days, and at the end the King claimed him as his brother, and he became
Prime Minister.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i>
(Swynnerton), p. 276 ff.</span>, a step-mother got two Princes exiled.
At night while they were under a tree two birds were heard predicting
that those who ate them would become a King and a Minister, so they
shot and ate them. The whip and snake incident are as above, the guilty
snake being brought up by a cowry shell, of which the magician had
despatched four to the four quarters. The snake breathed into the
Prince&rsquo;s mouth and revived him. He had wonderful adventures, and
married a Princess, went on a ship with her, was thrown overboard, and
assisted a gardener. The Princess had been sold at the palace, where
the King, who was the elder brother, wished to marry her. The younger
brother went disguised as a woman, and related his story by sections in
three days, when the Princess claimed him as her husband. His brother
made him Chief Counsellor, and at last he succeeded to his
father&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd
ed., p. 78</span>, the persons who ate the head and breast of a bird
became Kings.</p>
<p>At p. 159, the King&rsquo;s elephant selected a person as King, the
elephant bowing down to him, and the royal hawk perching on his
hand.</p>
<p>At p. 167 ff., two Princes who escaped their death sentence, which
was due to their step-mother&rsquo;s plotting, heard two birds say of
two others that they who ate them would become a King and Minister.
They shot and ate them. The whip and snake incident occurred, the
latter being a dragon. The elder brother was selected as King
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=

"corr" id="xd26e2970" title=
"Source: jog&#299;">j&#333;g&#299;</span></i> emptied the spring and
made the dragon restore the Prince, who was captured by robbers, saved
by the daughter of one, went with her on board a ship, was pushed
overboard, and was saved by the girl. They landed at the city where the
elder brother was reigning, and he was made Minister, and eventually
King when the elder brother succeeded their father.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Prince and the Princess</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city there are a Prince and a Princess,
it is said. Because these two go together to the school the teacher
said, &ldquo;You two came together to-day; on another day you must not
do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were coming separately on that account, the Princess,
being in front, one day went to the well, and having bent down while
trying to drink water, her writing style fell into the well. Being
there alone the Princess was unable to get the writing style.</p>
<p>After the Prince came up she said, &ldquo;An&#275;! My writing style
fell into the well; get it and give me it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;I will get it and give you it if you
will swear that you will not marry another person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;I will not marry another; I will only
marry you yourself.&rdquo; Having touched the Prince&rsquo;s body she
swore it, and the Prince having touched the body of the Princess also
swore it. Then he got and gave her the writing pin, and one of them
went in front and one went behind.</p>
<p>Those two learnt their letters excellently. Afterwards, both having
grown up, when they inquired about arranging the marriage for the
Prince he said, &ldquo;You must bring me in marriage such and such a
Princess, of such and such a village. If not, I do not want a different
marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;Do you want the kingdom, or do you want
the Princess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince replied, &ldquo;I do not want your kingdom at all; I want
the Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the King went and asked for the Princess. Then the father
of the Princess said, &ldquo;I will give the Princess to the persons
who give me this well full of gold.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>So the Prince filled it and gave it, and the Prince and Princess
having got married stopped many days at the Prince&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Then the King said to the Prince, &ldquo;Because at first you said
that you did not want the kingdom, that you only wanted the Princess,
you shall not live at my house. Go where you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then having gone to the Princess&rsquo;s house, after they had been
living there many days the father of the Princess said, &ldquo;Taking a
well of gold, I sold the Princess. You shall not live at my house. Go
where you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So those two went away. As they were going the Princess went along
sewing a jacket. Having gone very far, after they sat down at a
travellers&rsquo; shed near a city, the Princess gave the jacket that
she had sewn into the Prince&rsquo;s hand, and said, &ldquo;Take this,
and having sold it at the bazaar bring something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince having taken it to the bazaar, after he had told the
bazaar men to buy it they said, &ldquo;We are unable to say a word
about buying this. It is so valuable that we have not got the means to
purchase it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guards of the King of that country having been present looking
on, and having seen this, told the royal servants to bring the jacket
to the King. After they had brought it the King took it, and gave the
Prince two bags of money. The Prince left one and took one away.</p>
<p>The King having called his servants, ordered them, &ldquo;Look at
the place where that Prince goes and stays, and come back.&rdquo; Well
then, the servants having gone and having seen that the Princess was
stopping at the travellers&rsquo; shed, came running, and said at the
hands of the King, &ldquo;There is a good-looking Princess at such and
such a travellers&rsquo; shed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince having left at the travellers&rsquo; shed the bag of
money which he took, came for the other bag of money. While he was
coming, the King, taking a horse also, went to the travellers&rsquo;
shed by a different road, and placing the Princess on horseback brought
her to the palace.</p>
<p>Well then, when the Prince, taking the other bag of money
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>went to the travellers&rsquo; shed the Princess
was not there. He called and called; she did not come. Afterwards,
taking both bags of money he comes away along the road.</p>
<p>The Princess, while she was looked after by the guards, having seen
from afar that the Prince was coming, said to the servants, &ldquo;I am
thirsty,&rdquo; and told them to bring an orange quickly. After it was
brought and given to her, she opened the skin and wrote a letter thus:
&ldquo;Give even both those bags of money, and buying two horses come
near the palace, and having tied up the two horses stay there without
sleeping. After the King has gone to sleep I shall descend down robes
tied together, and having come to you, when I mount a horse you mount
the other horse, and we will go off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having placed the letter inside the skin of the orange and shut it
up completely, so as to appear like a whole orange fruit, she threw it
behind the guards, in front of the approaching Prince. The Prince
thinking, because he was hungry, &ldquo;I must eat this,&rdquo; picked
it up, and having gone into the shade of a Timbiri tree, sat down. When
he opened the skin of the orange, having seen that there was a letter
inside it he took it to the light, and read it aloud.</p>
<p>A Karum&#257;ntay&#257; (a Kinnar&#257;, a man of the lowest caste)
who was in the Timbiri tree heard all that was written in the letter.
Well then, the Prince having given the two bags of money and taken two
horses, and having come near the palace on the appointed day, tied the
two horses there. While he was there the Karum&#257;ntay&#257; also
came, saying, &ldquo;An&#275;! I also must stop here at this resting
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;Do not stay here. Should the King hear of it
he will drive us both away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Karum&#257;ntay&#257; replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say so. I also
am going to stop here to-day,&rdquo; and stayed there. The Prince went
to sleep; the Karum&#257;ntay&#257; remained awake.</p>
<p>After the King had gone to sleep, the Princess, descending down some
robes, came there. When she was mounting a horse, the
Karum&#257;ntay&#257; mounted the other horse, and both of them went
off together.</p>
<p>Having gone off, when the Princess looked after it became
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>light, she saw the Karum&#257;ntay&#257;.
Afterwards she stopped the horse, and said to the
Karum&#257;ntay&#257;, &ldquo;Get and give me a little water.&rdquo;
The Karum&#257;ntay&#257; said, &ldquo;I will not; get it to drink
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Princess had said it yet another time, the
Karum&#257;ntay&#257; dismounted from the back of the horse. When he
had gone for water, the Princess cut with her sword the throat of the
horse on which the Karum&#257;ntay&#257; came, and went off, making the
horse bound along. The Karum&#257;ntay&#257; having run and run a great
distance, returned again because he could not come up to her.</p>
<p>While the Princess was going on horseback, she came to a place where
seven Vaedd&#257;s were shooting with bows and arrows. Those seven
persons having seen the Princess coming, said to each other,
&ldquo;That Princess who is coming is for me.&rdquo; The Princess
having heard that saying, stopped the horse and asked, &ldquo;What are
you saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then each of the seven said, &ldquo;The Princess is for me, for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Princess said, &ldquo;You seven persons shoot your
arrows together. I will marry the one whose arrow is picked up in front
of the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, they all seven having at one discharge shot their
arrows, while the seven persons were running to pick up the arrows the
Princess went off, making the horse bound along. Those seven persons
having run and run for a great distance, returned again because they
could not come up to her.</p>
<p>The Prince having awoke, when he looked the two horses were not
there, and the Princess was not there. So he walked away weeping and
weeping.</p>
<p>Then, while the Princess was going near yet another city, putting on
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a clothes she went to the school at that city, and
there having begged from a child a slate<a class="noteref" id=
"n96.1src" href="#n96.1" name="n96.1src">1</a> and slate
pencil,<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n96.1">1</a> she wrote a name in
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a letters (D&#275;van&#257;gari).</p>
<p>When she had given it to the children who were at the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>school,
nobody, including also the teacher, was able to read it. Then the
teacher took it to the King of that country, and showed him it. The
King also could not read it. So the King appointed her as a teacher,
saying, &ldquo;From to-day the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a must teach letters
at the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, when the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a had been teaching letters for a
long time, men told the King tales about her: &ldquo;That is a woman
indeed; no Br&#257;hma&#7751;a.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King having said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is good,&rdquo; told
the servants, &ldquo;Inviting that Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, go to my flower
garden. If it be a woman, she will pick many flowers and come away
after putting them in her waist pocket. If it be a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a,
he will pick one flower, and come away turning it round and round near
his eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Br&#257;hma&#7751;a had reared a parrot. The parrot heard from
the roof of the palace the words said by the King, and having gone to
the school said to the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, &ldquo;The King says
thus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day, the Ministers having come to the school said, &ldquo;Let
us go to the flower garden,&rdquo; and inviting the <span class="corr"
id="xd26e3076" title=
"Source: Br&#257;ma&#7751;a">Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</span>, went there.
Keeping in mind the words said by the parrot, the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a
broke off one flower, and holding it near the eye came away turning it
round and round. The King looking on said, &ldquo;From to-day no one
must say again that it is a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, in that manner, when she had been there a long time, people
began to say to the King, &ldquo;No Br&#257;hma&#7751;a; that is a
woman indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King again said to the servants, &ldquo;To-morrow, inviting
the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, go to my betel garden. If it be a woman, she
will pluck many betel leaves, and go away after putting them in her
waist pocket. If it be a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, he will pluck one betel
leaf, and holding it near his eye he will come away turning it round
and round.&rdquo; Hearing that also from the roof of the palace, the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a&rsquo;s parrot having gone to the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a said, &ldquo;The King says so and so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day, the King&rsquo;s Ministers having gone to the school said,
&ldquo;Let us go to the betel garden,&rdquo; and inviting the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, went there. Keeping in mind
the words said by the parrot, in that very manner breaking off one
betel leaf, and holding it near the eye, she came away turning it round
and round. The King, looking on at it also, said, &ldquo;From to-day I
shall cut with this sword the one who says again that it is a
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a having carved a figure like the
Princess, gave it into the hands of the scholars, and said,
&ldquo;Taking this, go and collect donations (<i lang=
"si-latn">sam&#257;dama</i>). After you have gone, inviting to come
with you him who on seeing this figure recognises it, return with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the scholars, taking the figure, had gone to a city, the seven
Vaedd&#257;s saw it, and said, &ldquo;Here is the Princess.&rdquo;
Having drawn near they asked, &ldquo;How is it that she has gone away
for such a long time since she went from here that day? Where is she
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the scholars, saying, &ldquo;She is now at our city; let us go
there,&rdquo; inviting those seven persons, returned with them. After
they had come to the school the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a said, &ldquo;Cut
them down, the seven persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had cut them down, the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a said to the
scholars, &ldquo;Take this again. Again inviting him whom you meet,
return with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scholars took it again, and while they were going to another
city met that Karum&#257;ntay&#257;. After he had said,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Amm&#275;! Where did you go for such a long time?
Where is she now?&rdquo; the scholars replied, &ldquo;The Princess is
now at our city; let us go there.&rdquo; After they had come to the
school the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a said, &ldquo;Cut down that one
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had cut him down, she said to the scholars, &ldquo;Take
this again.&rdquo; The scholars, taking it, and having gone to another
city, met with the Prince. Having come in front of it, the Prince fell
down weeping. The scholars said, &ldquo;Do not weep. She is in our
city; let us go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had come to the school, the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a arose
quickly, and having thrown off the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a clothing,
dressed herself in her Princess&rsquo;s robes. Having prepared warm
water and made the Prince bathe, the Princess cooked ample food, and
gave him to eat. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>While she was doing this, the scholars having gone to the King said,
&ldquo;It was a Princess who was there. After we went to a city to
collect donations, having met with the Princess&rsquo;s Prince he came
back with us. Both of them are now at the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King, having come to the school, and having asked
about those things from those two, built a house with a tiled roof, and
gave it and half the village to the Princess as a present.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i>
(Knowles), 2nd ed., p. 86</span>, a Prince induced three persons who
were quarrelling over the ownership of some wonderful articles left by
their master, a Fak&#299;r, to run for three arrows which he discharged
in three directions. While they were absent, he took three of the
articles, and seating himself on a magic seat which was one of the
things, was conveyed away by it.</p>
<p>At p. 306 ff. of the same work, a Prince and Princess eloped when
the latter was about to be married to another Prince. While on their
way, she remembered some jewels which she required, and he returned for
them. In the meantime a robber had come up in the dark, and finding her
servant asleep had ridden off with the Princess, who thought he was the
Prince. When daylight came she found out her mistake, sent him to a
village for food, and then rode off alone; and calling at a
goldsmith&rsquo;s house for a drink, was detained and requested to
marry him. On her agreeing, he gave her gold ear-rings and her jewels,
with which she rode off, and stayed with a married couple, disguising
herself as a man. An elephant selected her as King. Then she got an
artist to paint her portrait, and she hung it in a thoroughfare of the
city, with a guard who seized all who recognised her. These proved to
be the robber, her servant, the goldsmith, and the two who befriended
her, and lastly the Prince. When the Prince saw her portrait he
fainted. He was first made Prime Minister, and afterwards the Princess
revealed herself to him, and he became King. The robber and goldsmith
were imprisoned, and the others rewarded. The resemblance to the
Sinhalese story is striking. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city there are seven elder brothers and
younger brothers, it is said. The seven have a younger sister, who
cooks and gives food to all seven.</p>
<p>While the seven brothers were cutting and cutting the sides of an
earthen ridge (<i lang="si-latn">n&#299;ra</i>) in the rice field, they
saw seven women coming, and said to them, &ldquo;Where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seven women replied, &ldquo;We are seven elder sisters and
younger sisters; and we are going to seek seven elder brothers and
younger brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the seven brothers said, &ldquo;We are seven elder brothers and
younger brothers. Stop with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seven sisters said<span class="corr" id="xd26e3144" title=
"Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;H&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seven brothers having brought the seven sisters to their house,
leaving them there went again to the rice field, and chopped the
ridges. Those seven sisters having boiled seven pots of paddy and
spread it out to dry, said to their sister-in-law, &ldquo;We are going
for firewood; you stay at home and look after these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had gone, that sister-in-law fell asleep. Then rain
having fallen, the seven large mats (<i lang="si-latn">m&#257;gal</i>)
on which the paddy was spread were washed away. When the seven sisters
came, and saw that the mats and paddy had been washed away, they seized
that woman, and having beaten her, drove her away from the house. So
she went to the foot of a Tamarind tree on the roadside, and stayed
there.</p>
<p>When a long time had passed after she went there, all those
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>seven women bore girls. The woman under the
Tamarind tree bore a boy.</p>
<p>As the eldest brother was going along the road on which was the
tree, the woman said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Elder brother, look at my
boy&rsquo;s horoscope.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the next brother was going she said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Elder
brother, look at my boy&rsquo;s horoscope.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I
will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, in that way all the six elder brothers refused.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the youngest brother was going, on her saying,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Elder brother, look at my boy&rsquo;s
horoscope,&rdquo; he said<span class="corr" id="xd26e3167" title=
"Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and went.</p>
<p>When he looked at it, the astrologer said, &ldquo;He is born such
that he will bring misfortune to those seven girls. The child will be
so lucky that he might obtain a kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the brother having returned, said to that woman, &ldquo;That
one has been born such that he will eat thee. Knock his head on a stone
or root, and kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman saying, &ldquo;It is good. Let him eat me,&rdquo; reared
him.</p>
<p>The child having become big, said at the hand of the woman,
&ldquo;Mother, now then, oughtn&rsquo;t you to bring me an assistant
(i.e. a wife)?&rdquo; The woman replied, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, who will
give in marriage to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the youth went to a place where they were grinding flour,
and having put a little flour under his finger nail, came back.
&ldquo;Mother, mother, quickly hold a basin,&rdquo; he said. The woman
held one. Then, when he put into the basin the little flour that was
under his finger nail, it filled it and ran over.</p>
<p>Having gone again to a place where they were expressing coconut oil,
in the same way he took a little coconut under his finger nail, and
came back. &ldquo;Mother, mother, hold that quickly,&rdquo; he said.
The woman held it. That also was filled and overflowed.</p>
<p>Again, having gone to a place where they were warming Palm-tree
syrup, in the same way he took some under his finger nail, and came
back. &ldquo;Mother, mother, hold that quickly,&rdquo; he said. That
also was filled and overflowed.</p>
<p>Afterwards the youngster said, &ldquo;Mother, cook cakes with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>those things, and give me them.&rdquo; So the
woman having cooked them, tied up a pingo (carrying-stick) load, and
gave it to him.</p>
<p>The youngster, taking the pingo load, went to his eldest
uncle<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3191src" href="#xd26e3191" name=
"xd26e3191src">1</a>. After he asked him for his daughter&rsquo;s hand
in marriage, the uncle said, &ldquo;Be off! Be off! Who would give in
marriage to Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From there he went to the next uncle, and asked him. That uncle
spoke in the same manner. All the six elder uncles spoke in the same
manner.</p>
<p>Then he went to the youngest uncle, and when he asked him the uncle
said, &ldquo;Put the packages of cakes there, then.&rdquo; (Intimating
by this that he accepted him as a son-in-law. He alone knew of the
nature of the boy&rsquo;s horoscope.)</p>
<p>Afterwards, having cooked and given Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; to
eat, the uncle said, &ldquo;My buffalo cow has died, Tamarind
&#7788;ikk&#257;. Let us go and bury it, and return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and having
gone to the place where the dead buffalo was lying, said, &ldquo;Uncle,
shall I make that get up?&rdquo; The uncle said &ldquo;H&#257;.&rdquo;
So Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; went to the low bushes at the edge of the
jungle, and came back cutting a white stick. Then calling out,
&ldquo;Into the cattle-fold, Buffalo cow! Into the cattle-fold!&rdquo;
he struck the buffalo. Then the buffalo cow that had been dead got up,
and came running to the cattle-fold. By the calves from that buffalo
cow the cattle herd was increased.</p>
<p>One day, while the six uncles and Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; were
watching cattle in the field, the uncles said, &ldquo;Tamarind
&#7788;ikk&#257;, we will watch. You go and eat, and come back.&rdquo;
After he had gone home, the six uncles cut all the throats<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3205src" href="#xd26e3205" name="xd26e3205src">2</a>
of his cattle. When he returned the six uncles said, &ldquo;An&#275;!
Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257;. Some men came, and having tied us all and
thrown us down in the dust, cut all the throats of your cattle. Not a
thing could we do.&rdquo; Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; said,
&ldquo;H&#257;. It is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was going away, having seen people burying a corpse he waited
while they were burying it, and after they had gone he dug out the
grave, and raised the dead body to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>surface. Then lifting
up the body and taking it to a tank, he bathed it, dressed it in a
cloth, tied a handkerchief round its waist, tied a handkerchief on its
head, put a handkerchief over its shoulder,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3214src" href="#xd26e3214" name="xd26e3214src">3</a> and placing
it on his shoulder went away with it.</p>
<p>After nightfall, having gone to a village, Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257;
set the body upright against a clump of plantain trees, and asked at a
house, &ldquo;An&#275;! You must give us a resting-place
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said this the men in the house replied, &ldquo;There will be
no resting-place here. Go away, and ask at another house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Don&rsquo;t say so. Our
great-grandfather is coming there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Women were driving cattle out of that garden. Tamarind
&#7788;ikk&#257; said to them, &ldquo;An&#275;! Our great-grandfather
is coming there. His eyes cannot see anything. Don&rsquo;t hit him, any
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a woman at the raised terrace of the shop, having knocked down
a stump, when she was throwing it at the cattle the dead body was hit,
and fell down. At the blow Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; went running
there, and cried out, &ldquo;App&#275;! Great-grandfather is
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men came out of the house and said, &ldquo;Tamarind
&#7788;ikk&#257;, don&rsquo;t cry. We will give you a quart measure of
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want either a quart measure of money or two.
Our great-grandfather is dead,&rdquo; Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; said,
and cried aloud.</p>
<p>Again the men said, &ldquo;App&#257;! Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257;,
don&rsquo;t cry. We will give you three quart measures of
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want either
three or four. I want our great-grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the men said, &ldquo;Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257;, don&rsquo;t
cry. We will give you five quart measures of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want either
five or six. Give me my great-grandfather.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span></p>
<p>The men said, &ldquo;Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257;, don&rsquo;t cry. We
will give you seven quart measures of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is good.
Give me them. What of that! Will our great-grandfather come to his
senses again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking the seven quart measures of money, and returning to his
village, Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; spread a mat on the raised veranda
of his house, and having put the seven quart measures of money on it,
was counting it. The six uncles having come, said, &ldquo;Whence,
Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257;, this money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#332;! Will people with cattle hides to sell become in want
of money?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, the six uncles having cut the throats of all the cattle
they had, and tied the skins into pingo loads, taking them to the
villages asked, &ldquo;Will you buy cattle hides?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men said, &ldquo;Go away. Go away. Who will give money for
cattle hides?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the uncles having come to their village, becoming angry with
Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257;, spoke together, &ldquo;We must kill
him.&rdquo; So they went to him and said, &ldquo;Tamarind
&#7788;ikk&#257;, let us go on a journey together.&rdquo; He
asked<span class="corr" id="xd26e3256" title="Not in source">,</span>
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; The six uncles said, &ldquo;A daughter of ours has
been asked in marriage. On that account we must go to-day to eat betel
at the house of the people who have asked for her. Tamarind
&#7788;ikk&#257; said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and went with the
uncles.</p>
<p>Having gone very far, they came to a foot-bridge made of a tree
trunk (<i lang="si-latn">&#275;dan&#7693;a</i>), and on seeing it the
uncles spoke together, &ldquo;Let us hang Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257;
under this, and go away.&rdquo; So they put him in a sack, and having
hung it under the foot-bridge, went off.</p>
<p>While he was under it, as a washerman bringing a bundle of clothes
was going over the bridge, Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; said,
&ldquo;App&#275;! The lumbago is a leetle better since I have been
hanging here.&rdquo; Then the washerman said, &ldquo;Tamarind
&#7788;ikk&#257;, I also have lumbago; hang me up a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257; said, &ldquo;If so, unfasten this
sack.&rdquo; After the washerman unfastened it, Tamarind
&#7788;ikk&#257; came out, and having put him in the sack, and again
tied it in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>same manner under the foot-bridge, took his
bundle of clothes, came to the rice <span class="corr" id="xd26e3273"
title="Source: fields">field</span> with it, and spread the clothes out
to dry.</p>
<p>As the six uncles were returning, they cut the fastenings of the
sack that hung under the bridge (thus letting it fall into the
stream).</p>
<p>While coming along afterwards to the village, they saw Tamarind
&#7788;ikk&#257; in the rice field spreading clothes out, and
asked<span class="corr" id="xd26e3280" title="Source: .">,</span>
&ldquo;Whence, Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257;, these clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said, &ldquo;&#332;! Will people who have to be under
foot-bridges become in want of clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The six uncles said, &ldquo;Hang us there also, Tamarind
&#7788;ikk&#257;,&rdquo; and they brought six sacks and gave them to
him. So he put the six uncles into the six sacks, and hung them under
the foot-bridge, and afterwards cut the fastenings of the sacks. Then
the six uncles were carried away down the river, and died in the
sea.</p>
<p>The six women (their wives) ran away; their six girls, saying,
&ldquo;Our fathers are going for clothes to wear. Let us go
also,&rdquo; also ran away.</p>
<p>So the six uncles, and the six women, and the six girls all died.
Tamarind &#7788;ikk&#257;, and his wife, and uncle, and aunt, and
mother, these five remained.</p>

<p class="first">In the <span class="bibl">J&#257;taka story No. 432
(vol. iii, p. 304)</span>, a similar incident to the last one is
related. A woman whom her son and his wife thought they had burnt while
asleep, frightened a robber when he came to the cave in which she had
taken refuge, and thus got his bundle containing jewels. When she
returned home next day with the jewels, and was asked by her
daughter-in-law where she got them, she informed her that all who were
burnt on a wooden pile at that cemetery received a similar present. So
she went there, and burnt herself.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Story of Madana K&#257;ma R&#257;ja</i>
(Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), p. 97 ff.</span>, a Prince
was requested to deliver letters to the departed relatives of all at
the palace of the King under whom he was employed, who twice before had
endeavoured to kill him by giving him apparently impossible tasks. By
the aid of the magical powers of his wives, he jumped into a pit of
fire with the letters, and was saved by Agni, the Fire God, who sent
him back next day out of the fire, with costly jewels and a splendid
dress. All the persons who were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106"
href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>hoping to kill him decided to
follow his example, and were burnt up. The Prince then became the ruler
of the kingdom.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. iii, p.
11</span>, in a Bengal tale by G. H. Damant, six men burnt a
farmer&rsquo;s house. He loaded two bags of the ashes on a bullock, and
on the way met some men driving bullocks laden with rupees, changed two
of their bags for his own, met the six men who burnt his house, and
told them he got the money by selling the ashes. They burnt their
houses and were beaten by people for trying to sell ashes. Then they
went to the farmer&rsquo;s house, tied him, put him in a sack, and
threw him into a river. He was saved by a man who was riding past, on
his offering to cut grass for his horse without pay. He rode off on the
horse, overtook the six men, and informed them that he found the horse
in the river, where there were many more. They persuaded him to throw
them in, tied in sacks, and all were drowned.</p>
<p>In the same journal, vol. iv, p. 257, the incident is given as found
among the Santals. A man who was in a sack, about to be drowned,
induced another, a shepherd, to take his place. The man then took
possession of the shepherd&rsquo;s cows, and when those who thought
they had killed him heard from him that there were many more in the
river, they allowed themselves to be tied up and thrown in.</p>
<p>In vol. xviii, p. 120, in a South Indian story by
Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;, a man who
had cheated some persons was carried off, tied up in a bag, to be burnt
alive. While firewood was being fetched, he induced a cow-watcher to
take his place, and he himself drove off the 1,001 cows of which the
man had charge. When his enemies returned to his house after burning
the watcher, they found him there to welcome them, the cows being all
around. He informed them that on going to Kail&#257;sa, the residence
of the God &#346;iva, after being burnt, he met his father and
grandfather, who stated that his allotted time on earth had not
expired, and sent him back with the cows. The others decided to go
also, and were tied up and burnt.</p>
<p>A variant of the last incident is also found in West Africa, and is
given in <i lang="fr">Contes Soudanais</i> (C. Monteil), p. 121. A
sorceress captured a youth, whom she wished to destroy enclosed in
three goat skins, and she set her daughter to watch the package while
she dug a pit and filled it with wood, which she set on fire. The girl
heard the boy apparently eating food inside, and questioned him about
it. He said, &ldquo;I have better than that; I have some
dainties.&rdquo; As she wanted some she released him and was tied up in
his place, while he escaped clothed in her dress. The sorceress
returned, and threw the bundle into the fire. Although she heard a
voice inside saying the boy had tied up the girl in it, she believed it
was only a trick of his.</p>
<p>A similar incident is related in another story in the same volume,
p. 164. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>It also occurs in a folk-tale of the Southern Province which I
contributed to <span class="bibl"><i>The Orientalist</i> (vol. ii, p.
53)</span>. As other incidents in that story resemble some in the tales
given below, I give it in full here.</p>
<p>I may add that however improbable the marriage of seven brothers to
seven sisters may appear, it has been nearly matched in recent years in
England. The <span class="bibl"><i>Daily Mail</i> of January 20,
1908</span>, contained the following words regarding an old lady who
had just died:&mdash;&ldquo;She was one of seven members of her family
who married seven sons and daughters of a neighbouring farmer.&rdquo;

<h2 class="main">M&#257;talang&#275; Loku-Appu</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there lived a man and a woman, whose
son was a youth named M&#257;talang&#275; Loku-Appu.</p>
<p>One day the mother went to the river to fetch water, telling her son
to allow nothing whatever to enter the house in her absence. While she
was away a small lizard (<i lang="si-latn">hikanal&#257;</i>) ran into
the house. As it approached, the boy called out to it to stop, but it
took no notice of him, and climbed up into the roof, whereupon
Loku-Appu set fire to the roof and burnt the house down. When his
mother returned, and asked him how the house came to be burnt, he
informed her that he had done it in driving the lizard out of the
roof.</p>
<p>Afterwards the father came home, and on learning what had occurred
set off into the forest with his son to cut sticks, in order to build a
new house. While he cut the sticks he ordered Loku-Appu to collect
them.</p>
<p>A river flowed through the forest, and Loku-Appu asked him where it
ran. &ldquo;To your house,&rdquo; he replied. The son, taking this
literally, threw all the sticks into the river, so that it might
transport them home. When the father discovered that all the sticks
were lost in this way, he flew into a passion, tied the boy on a log,
and set him afloat in the river, saying<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3361" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Go thou
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a short distance down the river there was a sweet-potato garden.
The gardener saw the log and boy floating past, and rescued Loku-Appu.
He inquired the boy&rsquo;s name, and was told it was
&ldquo;Uprooter-of-Creepers, Sweet-Potato-Eater.&rdquo; Nevertheless,
he placed the boy in charge of his garden. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p>After two or three days, the gardener returned to inspect his
garden, and found all the sweet potatoes pulled up and eaten. So he
tied the boy on the log again, and set him afloat once more.</p>
<p>Further down the river there was a plantain garden, the owner of
which saw Loku-Appu on the log, and drew him ashore. When asked his
name, Loku-Appu replied, &ldquo;Eater-of-the-first-Comb-of-Plantains,
Crusher-of-young-Plantain-Shoots.&rdquo; The man gave him charge of the
garden.</p>
<p>In a few days, the man came to see how his garden progressed, and
found everything broken down and eaten. On this, he at once
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3373" title=
"Source: dismisssed">dismissed</span> Loku-Appu.</p>
<p>Having nothing to live upon, Loku-Appu now began to borrow from some
tom-tom beaters. After a few months, these men, finding that he did not
repay them, called on him to make him come to a settlement. Loku-Appu
saw them at a distance, and guessing their errand, put a young girl
into the corn store-room, and began to trim a club with his knife.</p>
<p>When the creditors arrived he requested them to be seated. Soon
afterwards he fetched up an old woman who lived in the house, gave her
a smart blow with the club, and put her also into the corn-store.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, he called for betel to be brought, and the
little girl came out with it. At this, the tom-tom beaters were greatly
astonished, and made inquiries regarding the miracle, for such they
thought it. Loku-Appu told them that the virtue lay in the club, with
which all old women could be converted into young girls.</p>
<p>When they heard this, they became exceedingly anxious to possess the
wonderful club, but Loku-Appu refused to part with it on any terms. At
last, finding persuasion useless, the tom-tom beaters took it from him
by force, and went straight home with it.</p>
<p>There they called up part of the old women of their village, and
after beating them well with the club, put them into the corn
store-rooms. To give the charm time to work they waited three days.
Then they went to examine the old women, expecting to find them become
young again; but all were dead. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110"
href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>Full of anger, they went to Loku-Appu to tell him that he had
deceived them, and that the women were all dead. While they were still
at a distance, Loku-Appu cried out, &ldquo;Alas, alas! They have taken
hold of the wrong end of the stick!&rdquo; When they came near he
explained to them the blunder they had made. As they took the stick
from him by force he was not responsible for it.</p>
<p>This time he cut a mark on the right end of the stick to be used,
telling the tom-tom beaters that if the wrong end were used the women
would certainly die, while the proper end would as certainly change
them into young girls.</p>
<p>When the tom-tom beaters returned to their village they fetched up
all the rest of the old women, and after belabouring them well with the
proper end of the club, put them also into the corn-stores. Yet after
three days they found that the result was just the same as at first;
all the women were dead.</p>
<p>Determined to revenge themselves on Loku-Appu, they came to his
house, tied him up in a sack, and set off to the river with him,
intending to drown him. On the way, they heard the beating of tom-toms,
whereupon they set the sack down on the road, and went to see what it
was about.</p>
<p>During their absence, a Muhammadan trader in cloth who was coming
along the road, found the sack, and heard a voice proceeding from it:
&ldquo;Alas! What a trouble this is that has come upon me! How can I
govern a kingdom when I cannot either read or write?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trader immediately untied the sack, and questioned Loku-Appu as
to how he came there. Loku-Appu explained to the trader that he was
about to be made a king, but not possessing the requisite amount of
knowledge for such a high position he had refused the dignity; and now
he was being carried off in this way to be put on the throne. &ldquo;By
force they are going to make me king,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The trader remarked to him, &ldquo;It will be a great favour if you
will let them do it to me instead&rdquo;; and eventually they changed
places, Loku-Appu tying the trader in the sack, and he himself taking
the man&rsquo;s clothes and bundle of cloth. Loku-Appu then hid
himself. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a short time the tom-tom beaters came back, carried away the sack
with the would-be king, and threw it into the river.</p>
<p>As they were returning past a part of the river, they saw, to their
intense surprise, Loku-Appu washing clothes in it. They came to him and
said, &ldquo;What is this, Loku-Appu? Where have you come from? Where
did you get all this cloth?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;These are the
things which I found in the river bottom when you threw me in with the
sack. As they are rather muddy I am cleaning them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tom-tom beaters said that they would be greatly obliged if he
would put them in the way of getting such treasures, so he requested
them to bring sacks like that in which he had been tied.</p>
<p>They soon came back with the sacks, were tied up in them, and were
thrown into the river by Loku-Appu.</p>
<p>Then Loku-Appu went to the tom-tom beaters&rsquo; village, and took
possession of their lands and houses.</p>

been cheated by a farmer, called at his house regarding the matter. He
offered them food, and when they sat down to the meal struck his wife
with his bullock goad, and said, &ldquo;Be changed into a girl, and
bring in the curry.&rdquo; She went out, and sent back their little
daughter with the food. He then sold the men the magic stick for one
hundred and fifty rupees, telling them that if they beat their wives
well with it they would all recover their youth. They acted
accordingly, and beat them so thoroughly that the wives were all
killed. Then they returned and burnt the farmer&rsquo;s house down, as
noted at the end of the last story, where the later incidents are
given.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. xviii, p.

his wife, who was dressed as an old woman, with a pestle and put her
inside the house, explaining to his guests that he had only done it to
make her young again. Soon afterwards she reappeared as a young woman.
He lent them the magic pestle for a week, but by its use they only
killed their relatives. Then they returned in order to square up
accounts with him, tied him in a bag, and carried him up a mountain,
intending to burn him alive. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href=

vegetables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you,&rdquo; the two women go
on.</p>
<p>As they were going, they met with two jackal-dogs. &ldquo;Where are
you going?&rdquo; they asked the two women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to a country where they give to eat and to
wear,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we good enough for you?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you eat?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We eat a few fruits and crabs,&rdquo; the two jackals said.
&ldquo;What do you eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We eat dried-fish fry,&rdquo; they said. Saying<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3474" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;We do not
want two jackals,&rdquo; the two women still go on.</p>
<p>While they were going, an elder brother and a younger brother were
ploughing. They asked the two women, &ldquo;Where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to a country where they give to eat and to
wear,&rdquo; they said. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=

<p>&ldquo;Are we good enough for you?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>The two women asked, &ldquo;What do you eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We eat dry-fish fry,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then both parties eat it,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;It is
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, it is good. Go to our house,&rdquo; the men
said.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3492src" href="#xd26e3492" name=
"xd26e3492src">2</a></p>
<p>Afterwards those two men, having given the two keys of their houses
into the hands of the elder sister and the younger sister, said,
&ldquo;The cooking things are in such a place; go there, and having
opened the doors cook until we come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the two women went to the houses, and the elder sister opened
the door of the elder brother&rsquo;s house and cooked; and the younger
sister opened the door of the younger brother&rsquo;s house and cooked.
Afterwards the two men came home, and having eaten, stopped there [with
the sisters, as their husbands].</p>
<p>After many days had passed, the two sisters bore two girls. The
younger sister had many things at her house; the elder sister had none.
On account of that, the elder sister through ill-feeling thought,
&ldquo;I must kill younger sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, the two sisters having cooked rice, while they were taking
it to the rice field the younger sister went in front, and the elder
sister went behind. On the way, they came near the river. Then the
elder sister said, &ldquo;Younger sister, didst thou never bathe? The
skin on thy back is dirty. Take off that necklace and the clothes on
thy body, and lay them down, and let us bathe and then go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They put down the two mat boxes of cooked rice, and having descended
into the river, she called, while bathing, to her sister,
&ldquo;Younger sister, come here for me to rub thy back.&rdquo; While
rubbing she threw her into the middle of the river. Then she took the
two boxes of cooked rice and went to the rice field. The younger sister
died in the river.</p>
<p>After the elder sister went to the rice field, the younger brother
asked at the hand of the elder sister, &ldquo;Why has no one come from
our house?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115"
name="pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the elder sister said, &ldquo;And&#333;! Catch her
coming!<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3511src" href="#xd26e3511" name=
"xd26e3511src">3</a> Isn&rsquo;t she playing [illicit] games at
home?&rdquo; Having given the two boxes of rice to the elder brother
and the younger brother, that woman returned home.</p>
<p>Afterwards that younger sister&rsquo;s girl asked,
&ldquo;Loku-Amm&#257;,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3516src" href=
"#xd26e3516" name="xd26e3516src">4</a> where is our mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman said, &ldquo;And&#333;! Catch her coming! When I came
she was still stopping in the rice field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After it became night, the elder brother and the younger brother
having come home, the younger brother asked, &ldquo;Girl, where is thy
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl said, &ldquo;At noon she took cooked rice to the rice
field with Loku-Amm&#257;; she has not come yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger brother said, &ldquo;Where? She did not go to the rice
field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl said, &ldquo;At the time when I asked at the hand of
Loku-Amm&#257;, &lsquo;Where is our mother?&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;She
is at the rice field.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the elder sister, calling the elder brother and the
younger brother, both of them [to be her husbands], took her
sister&rsquo;s goods, and remained there with them. From the next day,
having cooked she gave the rice into the hands of the two girls to take
to the rice field.</p>
<p>After the girls had gone near the river for two or three days, they
saw one day a White Turtle in it, and approached and tried to catch it.
When the elder sister&rsquo;s girl went to catch it, it went to the
middle of the river; when the younger sister&rsquo;s girl went, it came
to the bank, and rubbed itself over the whole of her body.</p>
<p>After the elder sister&rsquo;s girl had gone home, she told the
elder sister of it: &ldquo;Mother, there is a White Turtle in the
river. When that girl goes it comes to her; when I go it swims far
away,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>That elder sister said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is good. I shall eat
it,&rdquo; and lay down. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href=
"#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>The younger sister&rsquo;s girl hearing it, went near the river, and
said, &ldquo;Mother, she must eat you, says Loku-Amm&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the White Turtle said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is good, daughter.
Let her eat. After she has cooked she will give you, also, a little
gravy, and a bone. Drink the gravy, and take the bone to the
cattle-fold, and having said, &lsquo;If it be true that you are our
mother, may you be created a Mango tree,&rsquo; throw it
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, when those two men came home, having seen that the woman
was lying down, &ldquo;What are you lying down for?&rdquo; they
asked.</p>
<p>Then the woman said, &ldquo;It is in my mind to eat the White Turtle
that is in the river.&rdquo; So the men went to the river, and having
caught the White Turtle, and brought it home, and cooked it, gave it to
the woman. Then the woman got up and ate it.</p>
<p>She gave the girl a little gravy, and a bone. The girl having drunk
the gravy, took the bone to the cattle-fold, and saying, &ldquo;If it
be true that you are our mother, may you be created a Mango
tree,&rdquo; threw down the bone.</p>
<p>After that, a Mango tree being created, in a day or two grew large
and bore fruit. As the two girls were going near the Mango tree they
saw that there were Mangoes on it, and went close to it. When the elder
sister&rsquo;s girl went to pluck the Mango fruits, the branches rose
up; when the younger sister&rsquo;s girl went to pluck them, the
branches bent down, and spread over her body and head. Well then, after
that girl had plucked and eaten as many as she wanted, the branches
rose again.</p>
<p>That also the elder sister&rsquo;s girl, having come home, told her:
&ldquo;Mother, there are fruits on the Mango tree at the cattle-fold.
When I try to pluck them the branches rise; when that girl tries to
pluck them the branches rub the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is good. I will split that and
warm it in the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After hearing that also, that girl, having gone to the Mango tree
said, &ldquo;Mother, having split you she must warm you in the fire,
Loku-Amm&#257; says.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Mango tree said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is good, daughter. Let
her split. A splinter having fallen will remain here. Take it, and
having said, &lsquo;If it be true that you are our mother, may you be
created a Kaekiri creeper,&rsquo; put it down at the back of the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the elder sister&rsquo;s two men came, having seen
that she was lying down, &ldquo;What are you lying down for to-day
also?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
<p>Then the woman said, &ldquo;Having split the Mango tree at the
cattle-fold, it is in my mind to have a few splinters warmed for me in
the fire.&rdquo; So the two men having gone to the cattle-fold, and
having cut and split up the Mango tree, and brought a few splinters
home, put them in the fire and fanned it. After that, the woman got up,
and warmed herself at the fire.</p>
<p>Then that girl went to the place where the Mango tree was, and when
she looked a splinter was there. Taking it, she came to the back of the
house, and having said, &ldquo;If it be true that you are our mother,
may you be created a Kaekiri creeper,&rdquo; she put it down. In a day
or two a Kaekiri creeper was created there, and bore fruits.</p>
<p>On going there, the younger sister&rsquo;s girl said, &ldquo;There
is fruit,&rdquo; and having plucked and eaten as many as she wanted,
she came home. When the elder sister&rsquo;s girl went to pluck them
there was not a single fruit.</p>
<p>Having returned home, the girl said regarding that also,
&ldquo;Mother, on the Kaekiri creeper which is at the back of the house
there are many fruits when that girl goes to it; when I go, not a
single one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is good. Having uprooted it I
will eat it in a dry curry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That girl after hearing that also, went near the Kaekiri creeper and
said, &ldquo;Mother, having uprooted you and cooked you in a dry curry,
she must eat you, says Loku-Amm&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kaekiri creeper said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is good, daughter. Let
her eat. At the place where I am uprooted there will be a Kaekiri root.
Take it to the river, and having said, &lsquo;If it be true that you
are our mother, be created a Blue-Lotus flower,&rsquo; throw it into
the river.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118"
name="pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>The elder sister having uprooted the Kaekiri creeper, took it home,
and having cooked the curry, ate. After that, the girl went to the
place where the Kaekiri creeper had been, and when she looked a Kaekiri
root was there. Having taken it to the river, and said, &ldquo;If it be
true that you are our mother, be created a Blue-Lotus flower,&rdquo;
she threw it into the river. Then a Blue-Lotus flower was created.</p>
<p>When the two girls were going together to the river to bathe, having
seen that there was a Blue-Lotus flower, that younger sister&rsquo;s
girl went and held out her hands in a cup shape. Then the flower which
was in the middle of the river came into the girl&rsquo;s hands, and
opened out while in her hands. When the elder sister&rsquo;s girl was
holding her hands for it, it goes to the middle of the river.</p>
<p>That girl having come home, said of it also, &ldquo;Mother, there is
a Blue-Lotus flower in the river. When that girl goes it comes to her
hands; when I go it moves far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;H&#257;! It is good. That also I shall seize,
and take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl after having heard that also, went and said, &ldquo;Mother,
she must pluck you also, says Loku-Amm&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Blue-Lotus flower said, &ldquo;Let that woman say so,
daughter. She is unable to pluck me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the woman having told at the hands of the two men,
&ldquo;Pluck the flower and come back,&rdquo; the two men having gone
to the river tried to pluck it; they could not. When they are trying to
pluck it, it goes to the middle of the river.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the men having told it at the hand of the King of the
country, and having told the King to cause the flower to be plucked and
to give them it, the King also came near the river on the back of an
elephant, together with the King&rsquo;s servants. The elder sister,
and the two girls, and the two men stayed on this side.</p>
<p>Then the people on this side and the people on that side try and try
to take that flower; they cannot take it. That younger sister&rsquo;s
girl having gone to one side, after looking on said, &ldquo;Indeed I am
able to take it, that flower.&rdquo; The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>King on the other
side of the river having heard that, while he was on the back of the
elephant, said, &ldquo;What is it, girl, that you are
saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then that girl said, &ldquo;O Lord, I am greatly afraid to speak; I
indeed am able to take it, the flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&#257;. Take it,&rdquo; the King said. Afterwards, when the
girl was holding her hands in a cup shape, the flower that was in the
middle of the river came into her hands.</p>
<p>Afterwards the King, taking that flower, and placing the girl on the
elephant, went to the King&rsquo;s city.</p>

<p class="first">In a certain country there are a woman and a man, it
is said. The man cuts jungle at a chena clearing; the woman is weaving
a bag. After the man comes home, the woman asks, &ldquo;Is the jungle
cut yet?&rdquo; The man says, &ldquo;A couple of bushes are cut; is the
bag woven?&rdquo; The woman says, &ldquo;A couple of rows are
woven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Continuing in that way, after the end of two or three days the man,
while returning from cutting jungle, saw a Kaekiri creeper at a
threshing-floor, and having come near, and seen that there was a fruit
on it, plucked and ate it. A Kaekiri seed remained fixed in his
beard.</p>
<p>After he came home, the woman, seeing it, asked, &ldquo;Where did
you eat Kaekiri?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;When I was coming home there was a Kaekiri
creeper at a threshing-floor on the way; on it there was a fruit. I ate
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman said, &ldquo;There will be more on that creeper.
After I have woven the bag let us go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, having gone with him to the threshing-floor, she saw
that the Kaekiri creeper had spread completely over the floor, and that
there were as many fruits as leaves. While plucking them, she bore a
girl there.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the man having plucked Kaekiri, and filled and tied up
the bag, said to the woman, &ldquo;Shall I take the girl, or shall I
take the bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman told him to take the bag, leaving the girl there. So the
girl was left at the threshing-floor, and the man and woman went home,
taking the bag of fruit with them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"

<p>While a Black Stork (<i lang="si-latn">M&#257;n&#257;</i>) and a
female Black Stork (<i lang="si-latn">M&#257;n&#299;</i>) were going
about seeking food, the female Stork saw that a girl was at the
threshing-floor, and having gone near it, cried out,
&ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! A thing for me! A&#7693;&#275;! A thing for
me!&rdquo; When the male Stork heard this he came running to the spot.
Having looked at the girl, the two Black Storks took her to their
house, and reared her there.</p>
<p>After a time, the girl having become big, the female Black Stork and
the male Black Stork said, &ldquo;Daughter, we must go for golden
bracelets and golden anklets for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that house there were a Parrot, a Dog, and a Cat, which were
reared there. The two Storks told the girl, &ldquo;Daughter, after we
have gone, do not reduce the food of either the Parrot, or the Dog, or
the Cat. Until we return, be careful not to put out the fire on the
hearth, and not to go anywhere whatever.&rdquo; After saying this, they
went to bring the golden bracelets and golden anklets.</p>
<p>That girl having been careful for two or three days in the way the
female Stork and male Stork told her, lessened the food of the Cat.
That night the Cat extinguished the fire on the hearth.</p>
<p>Next morning, the girl having gone to the hearth to cook, when she
looked there was no fire on the hearth. So she said to the Parrot,
&ldquo;Younger brother, last night I reduced the food of the Cat a
little. For that, the Cat has extinguished the fire on the hearth, and
now there is no fire for cooking. You go and look from which house
smoke is rising, and come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Parrot having gone flying, looked and looked. There was not
any coming from any other houses; from the house of the R&#257;kshasa,
only, there was a smoke. The Parrot having come home, said,
&ldquo;Elder sister, I looked at the whole of the houses. There was not
any; only from the house of the R&#257;kshasa the smoke came.&rdquo;
Afterwards the girl, having said, &ldquo;If so, younger brother, you
stop at home until I go and bring fire,&rdquo; went for the fire.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa was not at home; only the R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s
wife was there. The girl having gone to that house, said, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>&ldquo;Give me a little fire.&rdquo; Then that
woman made the girl boil and dry seven large baskets of paddy (unhusked
rice), and pound the paddy in those seven, and bring seven large pots
of water, and bring seven bundles of firewood. Then taking a piece of
coconut shell with a hole in it, she put ashes at the bottom, and
having placed a fire-charcoal on them, gave it to her. While the girl
was going home, the ashes fell through the hole all along the path.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the R&#257;kshasa came home, &ldquo;What is this,
Bolan?&rdquo; he asked the woman; &ldquo;there is a smell of a human
body, a human body that has been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;A girl came for fire. Thinking you would
come, I employed that girl, and having made her boil seven baskets of
paddy, and dry it, and pound it, and bring seven large pots of water,
and seven bundles of firewood, when I looked you were not to be seen.
Afterwards, having placed ashes in a piece of coconut shell with a hole
in it, I put a fire-charcoal on them, and gave her it. By this time she
will have gone home. There will be ashes along the path on which that
girl went. Go, looking and looking at the ashes-path,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>Afterwards the R&#257;kshasa went along the ashes-path. The Parrot
having seen him coming in the rice field, said, &ldquo;Elder sister,
the R&#257;kshasa is coming. Shut the door,&rdquo; he said. So the
girl, shutting the door and bolting it, stopped in the house.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa having come near the house, said, &ldquo;Here are
golden bracelets, O daughter. Here are golden anklets, O daughter. Open
the door, my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Parrot said, &ldquo;No golden bracelets, O elder sister. No
golden anklets, O elder sister. Open not the door, wise elder
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa ran to catch the Parrot. He could not catch
it; the Parrot went into the forest and stayed there.</p>
<p>Afterwards the R&#257;kshasa having come again near the house said,
&ldquo;Here are golden bracelets, O daughter. Here are golden anklets,
O daughter. Open the door, my daughter.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Dog, which was in the open space at the front of the house,
said, &ldquo;No golden bracelets, O elder sister. No golden anklets, O
elder sister. Open not the door, wise elder sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa having gone running after the Dog, and having
caught and killed the Dog, came again near the house, and said,
&ldquo;Here are golden bracelets, O daughter. Here are golden anklets,
O daughter. Open the door, my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Cat that was in the raised veranda said, &ldquo;No golden
bracelets, O elder sister. No golden anklets, O elder sister. Open not
the door, wise elder sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa, having gone running, killed also the Cat, and
again having come near the house, said, &ldquo;Here are golden
bracelets, O daughter. Here are golden anklets, O daughter. Open the
door, my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gam-Murung&#257;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3711src" href=
"#xd26e3711" name="xd26e3711src">1</a> tree said, &ldquo;No golden
bracelets, O elder sister. No golden anklets, O elder sister. Open not
the door, wise elder sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the R&#257;kshasa, having cut down and broken up the
Gam-Murung&#257; tree, again went near the house, and said, &ldquo;Here
are golden bracelets, O daughter. Here are golden anklets, O daughter.
Open the door, my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Murung&#257; logs said, &ldquo;No golden bracelets, O elder
sister. No golden anklets, O elder sister. Open not the door, wise
elder sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa, having set fire to the logs, and gone near the
house again, said, &ldquo;Here are golden bracelets, O daughter. Here
are golden anklets, O daughter. Open the door, my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the ashes of the burnt Murung&#257; tree said, &ldquo;No golden
bracelets, O elder sister. No golden anklets, O elder sister. Open not
the door, wise elder sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa, having collected the ashes, and taken them to the
river and placed them in it, and again having gone to the house, said,
&ldquo;Here are golden bracelets, O <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>daughter. Here are
golden anklets, O daughter. Open the door, my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the water of the river said, &ldquo;No golden bracelets, O
elder sister. No golden anklets, O elder sister. Open not the door,
wise elder sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, the R&#257;kshasa, having gone to the river, and having
drunk and drunk, could not finish the water, and at last he burst open
and died.</p>
<p>After that, the female Black Stork and the male Black Stork brought
the golden bracelets and golden anklets, and having given them to the
girl, remained there.</p>
<p class="storyLocation"><i>North-western Province.</i></p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>In a variant of this story, related by a Duray&#257; in the
North-western Province, the persons who abandoned the child were a
Gamar&#257;la and his wife, the Gama-mahag&#275;.</p>
<p>On the Storks&rsquo; finding it, they cried, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#257;!
I have met with a gem!&rdquo; Their home was in a rock-cave. When the
Parrot warned the girl that the R&#257;kshasa was coming, &ldquo;having
gone running, and having sprung into the cave, she shut the door. The
R&#257;kshasa says, &lsquo;Having brought bracelets for the arms,
jackets for the body, cloths for the waist, O daughter, open the door,
my daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Parrot said, &lsquo;It is false that there are
bracelets for the arms, jackets for the body, cloths for the waist.
Open not the door, my elder sister.<span class="corr" id="xd26e3746"
title="Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the R&#257;kshasa tried to kill the Parrot. Having flown
away it settled on a tree. The R&#257;kshasa having smashed the
Parrot&rsquo;s cage, again says, &lsquo;Having brought bracelets for
the arms,&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>The Cat warned the girl and was killed, then the Dog, next the
Ash-plantain tree, and lastly the Katuru-Murung&#257; tree. I now
translate again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that, he struck a finger-nail into the lintel, and
having struck another finger-nail into the threshold, the R&#257;kshasa
went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that, the male Black Stork and female Black Stork came.
Having come, they say, &lsquo;Having brought bracelets <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>for
the arms, jackets for the body, cloths for the waist, open the door, my
daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Parrot says, &lsquo;It is true that there are
bracelets for the arms, jackets for the body, cloths for the waist,
elder sister. Open the door, my elder sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As she was coming out opening the door, her foot was pricked
by a finger-nail, and the crown of her head by a finger-nail. Then
becoming unconscious she fell down, the finger-nails having entered
her. Both Storks together drew out the finger-nails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She recovered, and they gave her the things they had brought, but
sent her away. The rest of the story is an evident modern addition of
no interest. She went to a large chena, and was taken home by a widow
who was there.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>In another variant of the Western Province the two birds which
reared the child were Crows. After the child was born, the mother, a
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s wife (<i lang="si-latn">Gama-Mahag&#275;</i> or
<i lang="si-latn">Gama-Mahayiy&#257;</i>) said, &ldquo;Are we to take
the child, or are we to take the bag of Kaekiri?&rdquo; Her husband
replied, &ldquo;Should we take the child it will be [necessary] to give
it to eat and to wear; should we take the bag of Kaekiri we shall be
able to eat it for one meal.&rdquo; &ldquo;So the Gama-Mahag&#275;,
having put the child among the Kaekiri creepers, taking the bag went
home.&rdquo; The Crows carried away the infant, and called it <i lang=
"si-latn">Emal Bisaw&#257;</i>, Queen of the Flowers. When the girl had
grown up, the birds went to bring pearls for her to wear, after giving
her the usual injunctions regarding the food of the Dog, the Cat and
the Parrot. She reduced the Dog&rsquo;s food, and it put out the fire.
The Parrot found smoke rising from the house of a R&#257;kshas&#299;,
and guided her to the place. The R&#257;kshas&#299; was absent; her two
daughters gave the girl two amunas (nearly twelve bushels) of paddy to
pound. &ldquo;She thought, &lsquo;Having been pounded, go into the
house,&rsquo; and it became pounded of its own accord.&rdquo; Then they
gave her seven perforated pots to be filled with water and brought. She
filled them and handed them over. They gave her a piece of coconut
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>husk with a hole in it, and a perforated coconut
shell, and filled the former with sesame seeds, and the latter with
ashes on which was placed burning charcoal. She hurried home with
these, being warned by the Parrot that the R&#257;kshas&#299; was
coming.</p>
<p>When the R&#257;kshas&#299; asked her daughters who had been to the
house, they replied that the female Crow&rsquo;s girl had taken some
fire, and that there would be sesame and ashes along the path by which
she had gone. The R&#257;kshas&#299; ran along it, found the door shut,
and said, &ldquo;Mother has come. Father has come. We are bringing
pearls of the sea; we are bringing also wire for stringing the pearls.
Open the door, O daughter.&rdquo; The Katuru-Murung&#257; tree warned
her that it was false; when it was burnt, its ashes repeated the
warning, then the Dog, the Cat, and the Parrot. Then the
R&#257;kshas&#299;, &ldquo;having broken her finger nails, and having
fixed one above and one below in the door-frame, went away. After that,
her mother and father came, and said, &lsquo;Mother has come. Father
has come. We are bringing pearls of the sea; we are bringing also wire
for stringing the pearls. Open the door, my daughter.&rsquo; The Parrot
said the same. As she opened the door, a finger-nail having entered the
crown of her head she died. When they asked the Parrot, &lsquo;What has
happened?&rsquo; &lsquo;Because of the R&#257;kshas&#299; elder sister
died,&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>In a fourth variant of the North-western Province the aspect of the
story is partly changed, and I give a translation of the latter
portion, because it contains an account of a runaway match, such as
still sometimes occurs.</p>
<p>In this story, a Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s wife went with another woman
to the chena while the Gamar&#257;la was asleep, and after eating as
much fruit as possible they filled a bag also. As they were proceeding
home rapidly with it, the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s wife gave birth to a
child at a hollow in which pigs wallowed. She asked the other woman to
carry it home for her, but this person refused, and took the bag of
Kaekiri fruit instead, so the child was abandoned. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the two Storks came, and carried the child to their cave, and
reared it. After the girl grew up, they went off to seek bracelets and
necklaces for her, instructing the girl to &ldquo;give an equal
quantity of food to the Cock, the Dog, the Cat, the Parrot, the Crow,
the Rat, and the other creatures,&rdquo; and warning her that if she
gave less to the Rat it would extinguish the fire. After some days she
reduced the Rat&rsquo;s food, so it put out the fire.</p>
<p>The Parrot found a house&mdash;not a
R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s&mdash;from which smoke was rising, and guided the
girl to it. The woman who was at it gave her some fire without delaying
her, and she returned home with it. I now translate the concluding
part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the son of the woman who had the fire came home, the
woman says to her son, &lsquo;To-day a good-looking Princess came to
the house.&rsquo; Then the son asks, &lsquo;Mother, by which stile did
the Princess go?&rsquo; His mother says, &lsquo;Here, by this
stile,&rsquo; and showed him it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the man having set off, and having gone near the cave,
and seen the Princess, when he said, &lsquo;Let us go to our
house,&rsquo; the Princess said, &lsquo;Because my parents are not here
[to give their consent] I cannot go.&rsquo; This man says, &lsquo;No
matter for that,&rsquo; and seizing the hand of the Princess, they came
to his house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards the two Black Storks which went seeking bracelets
and rings, having come near the cave, when they looked the Princess was
not there. The Black Storks ask the Dog, the Cat, the Crow, the Parrot,
the Rat, and the Cock, &lsquo;Where is the Princess?&rsquo; They all
say, &lsquo;A man came, and while the Princess was saying she could not
go he seized her hand and took her away.&rsquo; When the Storks asked,
&lsquo;By which stile did he take her?&rsquo; saying, &lsquo;There, by
that stile,&rsquo; the animals showed them it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the two Black Storks having gone flying, when they
looked the Princess was staying at the house. Afterwards the two Storks
gave the Princess the bracelets, rings, and coral necklaces which they
had brought; and having handed her over to the man, the two Black
Storks went to their dwelling.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In <span class="bibl"><i>Old Deccan Days</i>, Ganges
Valley (Frere), p. 87 ff.</span>, there is a variant according to which
the child was carried off to their nest by two eagles, from the side of
the mother. After the eagles went to bring a ring for her, the cat
stole some food, and on being punished by the girl put out the
fire.</p>
<p>The girl went to a R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s house for a light, and was
detained by his mother, pounding rice and doing other housework. She
left at last with instructions to scatter corn along the path.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa followed the track and climbed to the nest, but
the outer door was bolted, and he could not enter, so he left his nail
in a crack of the door. When the girl opened the outer door&mdash;there
were seven in all&mdash;the nail wounded her hand, and being poisonous
apparently killed her. The eagles returned, and seeing this flew away.
When a King arrived and drew out the nail, she recovered, and he
married her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=

<p class="first">In a certain city there are a man and his daughter, it
is said. The man&rsquo;s wife being dead, the girl cooks food for the
man. The man cuts jungle at a chena clearing. The girl every day having
cooked, and placed the food ready for her father, goes to rock in a
golden swing.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3824src" href="#xd26e3824"
name="xd26e3824src">1</a> Then a Mahag&#275;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3828src" href="#xd26e3828" name="xd26e3828src">2</a> comes and
says, &ldquo;Daughter, give me a little fire.&rdquo; The girl sitting
in the swing says, &ldquo;Is it here with me? It is at the hearth; take
it.&rdquo; The Mahag&#275; goes into the house, pulls out and takes the
things which that girl has cooked and placed there, and having eaten,
carries away the fire.</p>
<p>So, after two or three days had passed in that manner, the man
asked, &ldquo;Who, daughter, while I am coming home has eaten the rice
that you have cooked and placed for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, father. Every day
when I have cooked the food and placed it ready for you, and gone to
rock in the golden swing, a Mahag&#275; comes and begs fire from me.
Then I say, &lsquo;Is it here with me? It is at the hearth; take
it.&rsquo; It will be the Mahag&#275;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man, having said, &ldquo;H&#257;. Daughter, cook and
arrange the food to-day also, and go to the golden swing,&rdquo; got
onto the shelf, and stayed there.</p>
<p>Afterwards the girl, having cooked and placed the food exactly as on
other days, went to the golden swing. Then the Mahag&#275; having come
on that day also, begged, &ldquo;Daughter, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>give
me a little fire.&rdquo; The girl said, &ldquo;Is it here with me? It
is at the hearth; take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Mahag&#275; having gone into the house, and drawn out the
pots, and eaten part of the rice, when she was about to rise after
taking the fire, the man on the shelf asked, &ldquo;What is that you
have been doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mahag&#275; said, &ldquo;What indeed! Why don&rsquo;t you invite
me [to be your wife]?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;H&#257;. Stop here.&rdquo; So the woman
stayed.</p>
<p>After a great many days had passed, the woman lay down. &ldquo;What
are you lying down for?&rdquo; asked the man.</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;It is in my mind to eat your daughter&rsquo;s
two eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the man called the girl, and said, &ldquo;Daughter, a
yoke of cattle are missing; let us go and seek them.&rdquo; While he
went with the girl, taking a cord, the dog also followed behind.</p>
<p>Having gone into a great forest, he said, &ldquo;Daughter, come here
in order that I may look at your head.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3859src" href="#xd26e3859" name="xd26e3859src">3</a> While he was
looking and looking at it, the girl fell asleep. Then the man placed
the girl against a tree, and tied her to it; and having cut out her two
eyes, came home and placed one on the shelf and one in the salt pot.
The dog that went with the man having come home, howled, rolling about
in the open space in front of the house.</p>
<p>There was also a child. That little one having gone somewhere, on
coming back bringing a mango, asked that Mahag&#275;,
&ldquo;Loku-Amm&#257;, give me a knife.&rdquo; The woman said,
&ldquo;Have I got one here? It is on the shelf; get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the child, going into the house, and putting his hand on the
shelf, caught hold of the eye placed there by the man, and said,
&ldquo;This is indeed our elder sister&rsquo;s eye. Loku-Amm&#257;,
give me a piece of salt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;Have I got any here? Take it from the salt
pot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the child put his hand into the salt pot the other eye was
there. He took it also. When he stepped down <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>from
the veranda of the house into the compound, the dog went in front, and
the child followed after him.</p>
<p>Having gone on and on, the dog came to the place in the great forest
where the girl was, and stopped there. When the child looked, his elder
sister was tied to the tree. He saw that red ants were biting her from
her eyes downward, and having quickly unfastened her he took her to a
tank, and bathed her. Then taking both her eyes in his hand, he said,
&ldquo;If these are our elder sister&rsquo;s eyes, may they be created
afresh,&rdquo; and threw them down. After that, they were created
better than before.</p>
<p>Afterwards the girl said, &ldquo;Younger brother, we cannot go again
to that house. Let us go away somewhere.&rdquo; So they went off. While
they were going along the road, a King was coming on horseback, tossing
and tossing up a golden Kaekiri fruit. The child, after looking at it,
said, &ldquo;Elder sister, ask for the golden Kaekiri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl replied, &ldquo;App&#257;! Younger brother, he will kill
both of us. Come on without speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the child another time said, &ldquo;Elder sister, ask for it
and give me it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King having heard it, asked, &ldquo;What, Bola, is that one
saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl replied, &ldquo;O Lord, nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not nothing at all. Tell me,&rdquo; the King said a
second time.</p>
<p>Then the girl replied, &ldquo;O Lord, I am much afraid to say it. He
is asking for that golden Kaekiri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;I will give the golden Kaekiri if thou wilt
give me thy elder sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child said, &ldquo;Elder sister and I, both of us, will
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the King, having placed the girl on horseback, went to his city
with the child, and married the girl.</p>
<p>After many days had passed, when the King was about to go to a war
the girl was near her confinement. So the King said, &ldquo;If it be a
girl, shake an iron chain. If it be a boy, shake a silver chain.&rdquo;
Afterwards the girl bore a boy, and shook a silver chain.</p>
<p>Before the King came back, the girl&rsquo;s father and
Loku-Amm&#257; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>(step-mother), having collected cobras&rsquo;
eggs, polang&#257;s&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3901src" href=
"#xd26e3901" name="xd26e3901src">4</a> eggs, and the like, the eggs of
all kinds of snakes, and having cooked cakes made of them, came to the
place where the girl was.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s Loku-Amm&#257; told her to eat some of the cakes.
When she did not eat them, that woman, taking some in her hand, came to
her and rubbed some on her mouth. At that very moment the girl became a
female cobra, and dropped down into a hole in an ant-hill. Her father
and Loku-Amm&#257; went home again. The infant was crying on the
bed.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the girl&rsquo;s younger brother was saying to the
golden Kaekiri:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">They&rsquo;ll me myself to kill devise;</p>
<p class="line">In bed the gold-hued nephew cries;</p>
<p class="line">As a lady, gold-hued sister rise,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3917src" href="#xd26e3917" name=
"xd26e3917src">5</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">the cobra returned [in her woman&rsquo;s form], and
having suckled and bathed the infant, and sent it to sleep, again
[becoming a snake] goes back to the ant-hill.</p>
<p>Then the King having returned, asked the younger brother,
&ldquo;Where, Bola, is thy elder sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child said, &ldquo;Our father and Loku-Amm&#257; having cooked a
sort of cakes came and gave us them, and Loku-Amm&#257; told elder
sister to eat. Afterwards, as she did not eat, Loku-Amm&#257;, taking
some, rubbed them on elder sister&rsquo;s mouth. At that very moment
elder sister became a female cobra, and dropped down into an
ant-hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King asked, &ldquo;Did she not return again, after she had
dropped down into the ant-hill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child replied, &ldquo;While I was calling her she came back
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;Call her again in that very way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the boy said to the golden Kaekiri,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">They&rsquo;ll me myself to kill devise;</p>
<p class="line">In bed the gold-hued nephew cries;</p>
<p class="line">As a lady, gold-hued sister rise.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p>Afterwards, the cobra came [in her woman&rsquo;s form], and having
suckled and bathed the child, and sent it to sleep, cooked for the
King, and apportioned the food for him.</p>
<p>Then when she tried to go away [in her cobra form], the King cut the
cobra in two with his sword. One piece dropped down into the ant-hill;
the other piece became the Queen, and remained there.</p>
<p>After that, the King collected cobras, polang&#257;s, all kinds of
snakes, and having, with the Queen, put them into two corn measures,
they took the two boxes, and went to the house where the Queen&rsquo;s
father and Loku-Amm&#257; were. There they gave them the two boxes, and
said, &ldquo;We have brought presents for you. Go into the house, and
having shut the door, and lowered the bolt, open the mouths of the two
boxes. Otherwise, do not open the mouths in the light.&rdquo; The King
and Queen remained outside.</p>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s father and Loku-Amm&#257;, taking the two boxes,
went into the house, and having shut the door and bolted it, opened the
mouths of the two boxes. At that moment, the snakes that were in them
came out, and bit both of them, and both of them died.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the King and Queen came to the city, and stayed
there.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city there were a woman and a man, it is
said. Both of them were deaf. A female child was born to that man, and
this child was also deaf. The man to whom she was given in marriage
when she grew up was also deaf.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s husband went to plough a rice field at the side of
the high road. While he was ploughing, a man who was going along the
road asked the way. Continuing to plough with the yoke of bulls, the
deaf man said, &ldquo;I brought this bull from the village. This other
bull is from father-in-law&rsquo;s herd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the facts about the bulls to me? Tell me the
way,&rdquo; the man said.</p>
<p>The deaf man replied, &ldquo;The bull is from my herd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said again, &ldquo;What are the facts about the bulls to me?
Tell me the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the deaf man, replying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that another
time,&rdquo; beat the man with the goad, and the man having received
the blows went away.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the deaf man&rsquo;s wife having brought cooked rice to
the field, he unfastened the cattle which had been ploughing, and while
he was eating said to the woman, &ldquo;A man came just now, and
saying, &lsquo;Whose is the yoke of bulls?&rsquo; quarrelled with me
about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman replied, &ldquo;Through seeking firewood and water and
vegetables, and cooking, I was a little late in the day in
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having quarrelled with him over it, she bounded off, and having gone
home, went to the place where her mother <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>was plaiting a mat,
and said to her, &ldquo;Mother, our house man quarrelled with me,
saying that I was late in taking the rice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;Marry thy father! What is it to thee whether
my works are good or not good now?&rdquo; and she quarrelled with
her.</p>
<p>The woman having gone to the place where her husband was watching a
sweet-potato chena during the day time, on account of thieves uprooting
the plants, said, &ldquo;To-day my daughter having taken cooked rice to
the field, and having given it and returned, quarrelled with me, saying
that the plaiting of my mat was bad. I also indeed scolded her a great
deal, saying, &lsquo;What is it to thee whether my works are good or
not good now?&rsquo; I have come to tell you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man said, &ldquo;Bola, you infamous woman! Because I
stopped in the chena you cooked and ate three sweet-potatoes, did
you?&rdquo; and he beat and drove away the woman.</p>
<p>Then saying that it was useless to go on with the chena when his
wife was eating the crop, he cut the fence, and abandoned it to the
cattle. And the man left the village and the district, and went
away.</p>

<p class="first">The quarrels of deaf persons through misunderstanding
each other&rsquo;s remarks form a common subject of folk-tales. The
mistakes of three deaf people are related in <span class=
"bibl"><i>Folklore in Southern India</i> (Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a
S&#257;str&#299;), p. 3 ff.</span>, and <span class="bibl"><i>Tales of
the Sun</i> (Kingscote and N. S&#257;str&#299;), p. 1 ff.</span></p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; Dubois published another amusing South Indian
variant, which recounted the mistakes of four deaf men (<i lang="fr">le
Pantcha-Tantra</i>, 1872, p. 339 ff.). The four persons in it were a
shepherd, a village watchman, a traveller who was riding a stolen
horse, and a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a. The shepherd requested the watchman
to look after his flock during his temporary absence. In reply the
latter refused to let him have the grass that he had cut. On the
shepherd&rsquo;s return, he offered him a lame lamb as a reward for the
trouble he thought the man had taken, but the watchman fancied he was
being accused of laming it. They stopped a horseman who was riding
past, and asked him to decide their quarrel. In reply, he admitted that
the horse was not his. Each thought the decision was against him, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>cursed him for it; and while the quarrel was at
its height they referred it to a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a who came up, who
replied that it was useless for them to stop him, as he was determined
never to return to his wicked wife. &ldquo;In the crew of devils I defy
any one to find one who equals her in wickedness,&rdquo; he said. The
horse-thief, observing men coming in the distance, made off on foot,
the shepherd returned to his flock, the watchman, seeing the lamb left,
took it home in order to punish the shepherd for his false charge, and
the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a stayed at a rest-house, and went home again
next day.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="fr">Contes Soudanais</i> (W. Africa), by C. Monteil,
p. 18 ff., there is a story which resembles both this South Indian one
and the Sinhalese one, in part. A shepherd in search of a lost sheep
asked a cultivator about it. He replied, &ldquo;My field begins before
me and ends behind me.&rdquo; The shepherd found the sheep, and offered
it to the cultivator in payment for quarters for the night. The latter
thought he was being charged with stealing it, and took him before a
village headman, who remarked, &ldquo;Still another story about women!
Truly this can&rsquo;t continue; I shall leave the village.&rdquo; When
he told his wife to accompany him, she said she would never live with a
man who was always talking of divorcing her. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Prince and the Yak&#257;</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A king of a single city had one son, who was a Prince
of five years. At that time, a Yak&#257;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4054src" href="#xd26e4054" name="xd26e4054src">1</a> having
settled in that kingdom began to devour the people of the city, and by
reason of this the whole city was like to be abandoned. At last, the
King and the men of the city, making great efforts, seized the
Yak&#257;, and having made an iron house, put him in it, and shut the
door.</p>
<p>At that time it became necessary for the King of the city to go to
war. After he had gone off to the war, when the King&rsquo;s son one
day had opened the door of the house in which was the man-eating
Yak&#257;, and was looking at him, the Yak&#257; fell down, and made
obeisance to him, and signifying his misery to the Prince, began to
weep. So the Prince, pitying him, told the Yak&#257; to go away. Then
the Yak&#257;, saying to the Prince, &ldquo;It is good. I will assist
you, too,&rdquo; went away.</p>
<p>After he had left, when the Prince had gone home the King who had
gone to the war returned, having conquered. When he looked at the room
in which the Yak&#257; had been, the door was open. The King asked who
had opened the door. The Queen replied that the Prince opened it. Then
the King said, &ldquo;To-morrow I must behead that wicked
Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen, being sorry at this, having tied up a packet of cooked
rice, and given it and money to the Prince, and having given him a
horse and sword, said, &ldquo;The King has settled to behead you
to-morrow for letting the Yak&#257; escape. Go away at night to any
country you like.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href=
"#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>So the Prince, taking the money and the bundle of cooked rice, and
the sword, mounted the horse, and set off to go to another country.
There was a travellers&rsquo; shed at the road along which he was
going. As he was unable to go further on account of weariness, he went
that night to the travellers&rsquo; shed; and having fastened the horse
to one of the posts of the shed, he lay down, placing the bundle of
rice at his side.</p>
<p>Then seeing a youth running along the road, he called him, and
asked, &ldquo;Boy, where art thou going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy said, &ldquo;I am going to a place where they give to eat
and to wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;I will give you pay. Stop and look
after my horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth said, &ldquo;It is good. I will stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I do not know the fords in this country;
therefore tell me of a path by which we can go to another
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth replied, &ldquo;There is a river here. On the other side
of it there is a city, to go to which there is not a short road from
here. However, there is another road further on. By it we must pass
over a bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;having bathed here let
us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having seen that three Princesses who were at the city on the other
side were bathing, he also was pleased at bathing there. After he had
gone to bathe, the three Princesses of the King of the country on the
other side, when they looked saw the good figure of this Prince.</p>
<p>After that, as the Prince wished to go after bathing, the youth who
was to look after the horse having mounted it, began to ride away,
wearing the Prince&rsquo;s clothes, and taking the sword.</p>
<p>When the Prince, having bathed, and seen the Princesses on the other
bank putting on their clothes, came ashore to put on his clothes, on
his looking for them there were no clothes, no sword, no horse. The
youngest Princess of the three who had bathed on the other side well
knew what had happened.</p>
<p>This Prince, having on only his bathing cloth, bounded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>off,
and while running along overtook the horse and youth. When he was still
far away, the youth said, &ldquo;Do not come near me; should you come I
will cut you with the sword. If you are willing to look after this
horse, take hold of its tail and come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then because that one in any case must go to the city, he said,
&ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and having taken hold of the horse&rsquo;s
tail went with him. Going thus from there, they arrived at the
city.</p>
<p>It was a custom of the King of that country that, having sent a
guard, when any one of the men of another country arrived, he was to
write the names of those persons, and come to the King. When these
persons arrived, a guard being there asked their names. The youth who
came on the horse said, &ldquo;My name is M&#257;nikka
Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;; except the youth who looks after my horse,
there is no one else with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guard having gone, said to the King, &ldquo;Lord, a person
called M&#257;nikka Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275; has come and is
there, together with a horse-keeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King thought, &ldquo;Because the man called M&#257;nikka
Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275; has this name, M&#257;nikka, he will be
able to value my gem&rdquo; (<i lang="si-latn">m&#257;nikya</i>). A gem
of the King&rsquo;s having been taken through the whole country, no one
had been able to value it.</p>
<p>So having summoned that M&#257;nikka
Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275;, the King, after giving him food and
drink, showed him it, and said, &ldquo;M&#257;nikka
Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275;, there is my gem. Can you value
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That M&#257;nikka Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275; replied, &ldquo;My
horse-keeper will tell you the value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King became angry because he said, &ldquo;My horse-keeper will
tell you it,&rdquo; and indignantly caused the horse-keeper to be
brought speedily, and asked, &ldquo;Can you value this?&rdquo; The
horse-keeper Prince said, &ldquo;If I try hard I can.&rdquo; Then the
King gave it into his hands.</p>
<p>Taking it and weighing it, and learning when he looked at it that
there was sand inside the gem, he said, &ldquo;As it now appears to me,
the value of this gem is four sallis&rdquo; (half-farthings).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>The King becoming angry asked, &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince replied, &ldquo;There is sand inside this gem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King asked, &ldquo;Can you cut it, and show me
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse-keeper said, &ldquo;If you will ask for the sword
belonging to that M&#257;nikka Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275;, I will
cut it and show you it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King gave him the sword that was in the hand of the
Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275;. Then the horse-keeper, taking the
sword, and remembering the name of his father the King, and thinking,
&ldquo;By the favour of the Gods, if it be appointed that it will
happen to me to exercise sovereignty over this city, I must cut this
gem like cutting a Kaekiri fruit,&rdquo; put the gem on the table, and
cut it with the sword. Then the sand that was in the gem fell out,
making a sound, &ldquo;Sara sara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the King, thinking, &ldquo;When this horse-keeper knows
so much, how much doesn&rsquo;t this Se&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la
know!&rdquo; having given food and drink to the horse-keeper, and also
to the Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275;, and having greatly assisted
them, made them stay there a little time.</p>
<p>The youngest Princess well knew the wicked things that this
Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275; was saying about the horse-keeper
youth. On account of her great sorrow concerning this horse-keeper, the
Princess instructed the butler who gave the food at the royal house:
&ldquo;Give the horse-keeper who accompanied that M&#257;nikka
Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275;, food like that you prepare for me, and
a bed for sleeping on, and assist him a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the butler and the rest helped him. The Prince was
unwilling to enjoy that pleasure. &ldquo;An&#275;! I am a horse-keeper.
Do not you assist me in that way,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, the King&rsquo;s youngest Princess, for the sake of
sending the Prince away from the post of looking after the horse, went
to the King, and wept while saying thus: &ldquo;An&#275;!
Father,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4131src" href="#xd26e4131" name=
"xd26e4131src">2</a> because of this youth who looks after them, my
sheep are nearly finished. On that account, taking the horse-keeper who
came with that Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275;, to look after my sheep,
let us send the youth who looks after the sheep to look after the
horse.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>The King replied, &ldquo;Having asked the
Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275; we can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King having asked the Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275; the thing
she told him, &ldquo;You can do it,&rdquo; he said; and after he had
thus spoken to the Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275; it was done. So the
horse-keeper went to look after the sheep. Having gone there, while he
was looking after them for a long time, the sheep increased in number
by hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>One day, when the King had gone for hunting sport into the midst of
the forest, he was seized there by a Yak&#257;. After being seized, he
undertook to give the Yak&#257; the King&rsquo;s three Princesses, and
having escaped by undertaking this charge he came back.</p>
<p>Next day he made a proclamation through the whole city by beat of
tom-toms. What was it? &ldquo;Having been seized yesterday in the
forest by a Yak&#257;, I only escaped by promising to give him my three
Princesses. To-morrow a Princess, on the day after to-morrow a
Princess, on the day after that a Princess; in this manner in three
days I am giving the three Princesses. If a person who is able to do it
should deliver them, having married that person to them, I will appoint
him to the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then M&#257;nikka Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275; said, &ldquo;I can
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that day, that Prince who was looking after the sheep went to
look after them. While he was there, a man, taking a sheep, ran off
into the chena jungle. While bounding after him in order to recover it,
having gone very far, the Prince saw him go down the hole of a
polang&#257; snake.</p>
<p>After going near the polang&#257;&rsquo;s hole, and looking down it,
and seeing that the hole descended into the earth, the Prince went
along that tunnel. Having gone on from there it became dark, and going
on in the darkness he saw a very great light. Having gone to the light,
when he looked about there was a man asleep, wearing very many
clothes.</p>
<p>Then it was in the mind of this shepherd to go away, and in his mind
not to go. If you should say, &ldquo;Who was sleeping there?&rdquo; it
was the Yak&#257; who had formerly been in that iron house, and had
left it. That Yak&#257; at that very time saw in a dream that the
Prince who had sent him out of that house <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>had come to him, and
was there. While seeing him in the dream, the sleeping Yak&#257; awoke,
and when he looked up the Prince was beside him.</p>
<p>The Yak&#257;, getting up from there, went to the Prince, and while
he was embracing him the Prince became afraid. Then the Yak&#257; said,
&ldquo;Lord, let not Your Majesty be afraid. The Yak&#257; whom you
sent away from that house is I indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Prince sat down. Then the Yak&#257; asked,
&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince replied, &ldquo;That I sent you away, our father the King
decreed as a fault in me, and appointed that I should be beheaded. Then
our mother, having tied up and given me a bundle of cooked rice, told
me to go anywhere I wanted.&rdquo; Having said this he told him all the
matter.</p>
<p>After that, the Yak&#257; brought the lost sheep, and having given
it to the Prince, asked, &ldquo;What more do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I want another assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the assistance?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The Prince replied, &ldquo;After I had remained in this way, the
King, the father of the Princess who looks after the sheep, and of two
more Princesses, having gone hunting and been caught by a Yak&#257;, is
giving the three Princesses to him as demon offerings. If there should
be a person who can deliver them, he has made proclamation by beat of
tom-toms that having given to him the three Princesses in marriage, he
will also give him a part of the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yak&#257; said, &ldquo;It is good. I will bring and give you
victory in it. Be good enough to do the thing I tell you. After you
have eaten rice in the evening, be good enough to come to this
palace.&rdquo; He then allowed the Prince to return home.</p>
<p>The Prince having eaten his rice in good time, went to the
Yak&#257;. After he had gone there, the Yak&#257; having given him a
good suit of clothes, and a horse, and a sword, instructed him:
&ldquo;As you go from here there will be a path. Having gone along that
path, there will be a great rough tree. Go aside at it, and while you
are waiting there the Yak&#257; from afar will make a cry,
&lsquo;H&#363;.&rsquo; Having come to the middle of the chena jungle he
will say again, &lsquo;H&#363;, H&#363;, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>H&#363;.&rsquo; At
the next step, having bounded to the place where the Princess is
stopping, he will again say, &lsquo;H&#363;.&rsquo; After he has said
this, as he comes close to the Princess you will be good enough to step
in front. Then the Yak&#257;, becoming afraid, will look in the
direction of your face; then be good enough to cut him down with the
sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince having gone in that manner to the tree, when he looked
about, M&#257;nikka Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275; having climbed
aloft was in a fork of the trunk, lamenting, having turned his back.
While he was lamenting he saw this Prince coming, and [thinking it was
the Yak&#257;], trembled and lost his senses.</p>
<p>Then, in the very manner foretold, the Yak&#257; came, crying and
crying out. As he came near the Princess, the Prince cut him down, and
having drawn out and cut off his tongue, and also asked for a ring off
the hand of the Princess, came away to the palace of the friendly
Yak&#257;. Having arrived there, and placed there the clothes, the
horse, and the tongue, all of them, he returned to his house before any
one arose.</p>
<p>M&#257;nikka Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275;, having descended in
the morning, chopped the Yak&#257;&rsquo;s body into bits, and smeared
the blood on his sword. While he was there, the King went in the
morning to see if the Princess was dead or alive. Having arrived there,
he saw M&#257;nikka Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275; there looking on,
and he returned to the city, taking M&#257;nikka
Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275; and the Princess.</p>
<p>On the next night, also, they went and tied another Princess. The
Prince that night also having gone there, killed a Yak&#257; who came,
and cut off the Yak&#257;&rsquo;s tongue, and after asking for a
jewelled ring came away. That time, also, M&#257;nikka
Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;r&#275; went there, and after smearing blood on
his sword remained there. The King went there in the morning, and
calling the two persons came away.</p>
<p>On the following day he did the very same to the other Princess.
This Prince, having taken away the three jewelled rings that were on
the hands of the three Princesses, and the three tongues of the three
Yak&#257;s that he had cut off, remained silent.</p>
<p>As M&#257;nikka Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; had come falsely smearing
blood on his sword each morning, as though he had killed the
Yak&#257;s, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144"
name="pb144">144</a>]</span>King sent letters to all royal personages:
&ldquo;M&#257;nikka Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; has cut down three such
powerful Yak&#257;s, and has delivered the three Princesses who had
been devoted to be given as a demon offering to the Yak&#257; who
seized me when I went hunting. Because of that, I am giving the three
Princesses to him in marriage. You must come to the festival, and look
at the Yak&#257;s who have been killed.&rdquo; After that, the royal
persons came from those countries.</p>
<p>While they were there, that Prince went to the palace of the
friendly Yak&#257;. The Yak&#257; having given that Prince golden
clothes, and a golden crown and necklace, and a golden sword, told him
to go, taking those rings and tongues, and mounted on a white horse.
The Prince putting on those things, and mounting the white horse,
went.</p>
<p>When he went to the palace where the royal persons were who had come
to fulfil the object of the occasion, those royal persons became
afraid, and having made obeisance to him, asked, &ldquo;Lord, where is
Your Majesty going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;I have cut down a very powerful sort of
Yak&#257;.&rsquo; Letters went through foreign countries to this
effect, and that there is a marriage festival for the person who killed
the Yak&#257;. On account of the news I also have come to look,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>After that, those royal persons said, &ldquo;It is good,
Lord,&rdquo; and with pleasure showed him the heads of the
Yak&#257;s.</p>
<p>Then this Prince asked, &ldquo;Is there or is there not a tongue to
every living being whatever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every one said, &ldquo;Yes, there is one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince having looked for the tongues in the mouths of the
Yak&#257;s, asked, &ldquo;What is this, that there are not tongues for
these Yak&#257;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, every one asked it of M&#257;nikka
Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;. M&#257;nikka Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; being
afraid, remained without speaking.</p>
<p>Then he asked it of the two eldest Princesses. The two Princesses
said, &ldquo;We do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time when he was asking it of the youngest Princess, she
replied, seizing the hand of the Prince who split off the tongues and
took the jewelled rings, &ldquo;This one went away after taking in his
hand the ring, and cutting off the tongue <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>of the

rings and the three tongues, and showed them.</p>
<p>Speedily having beheaded and cast out M&#257;nikka
Se&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, they carried out the wedding festival of the
marriage of the three Princesses to the Prince. After that, those royal
personages went to their own kingdoms, and the kingdom having been
bestowed on this Prince he remained there ruling it.</p>

<p class="first">In the J&#257;taka story No. 510 (vol. iv, p. 305), an
iron house was built, in which a King&rsquo;s son was confined for
sixteen years in order to preserve him from a female Yak&#257; who had
carried off two children born previously. The demon was unable to break
into it.</p>
<p>In the J&#257;taka story No. 513 (vol. v, p. 13), there is an
account of a King who was seized by an Ogre while hunting. The latter
allowed the King to go home on a promise to come back next day to be
eaten. His heroic son returned in his place, but was spared by the
Ogre. The Prince said of these beings, &ldquo;The eyes of Ogres are

<h2 class="main">How a Yak&#257; and a Man fought</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country three men went shooting,<a class=
"noteref" id="n146.1src" href="#n146.1" name="n146.1src">1</a> it is
said. At the time when the three persons were going, one man was
obliged to go aside for a certain purpose. The man went aside without
telling those two men.</p>
<p>A Yak&#257; saw the man separate from those two persons. Having seen
it, the Yak&#257; seized the man, and began to push against him. At
that time those two men were very distant. The men having said,
&ldquo;What has happened to this man?&rdquo; came to look for him. When
they came [they saw that] there was a black one near the man. The two
persons spoke together, &ldquo;Let us shoot this black one.&rdquo; So
they shot<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n146.1">1</a> him. Then the
black one went out of the way.</p>
<p>Afterwards the men went to look near at hand. When they went the man
had fallen. After that, having taken hold of the man and raised him,
when they looked at him the man&rsquo;s body having gone quite slimy he
was unconscious also.</p>
<p>Afterwards, while the two men, raising [and carrying] that man, were
[endeavouring] to come away, the Yak&#257; did not allow them to come.
He shakes the bushes; he breaks the trees; he blocked up the path all
along. One man of the two men looked upward. Then the Yak&#257; spit
into the man&rsquo;s eye, and the man&rsquo;s eye became blind.</p>
<p>Well then, the two men having uttered and uttered spells, with pain
lifting up [and carrying] that man, came <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>to the village.
Having come there, and summoned a Yaksa Vedar&#257;la<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4248src" href="#xd26e4248" name="xd26e4248src">2</a> to
restore the man to consciousness, when he arrived they showed him this
man. Then the Yaksa Vedar&#257;la told them to warm a large pot of
water. So they warmed the water. After that, having bathed the man, and
having uttered spells, after the Vedar&#257;la had tied protective
written spells and diagrams<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4251src" href=
"#xd26e4251" name="xd26e4251src">3</a> on him the man became
conscious.</p>
<p>After that, the Yaksa Vedar&#257;la and those two men asked about
the circumstances that had occurred. The man said, &ldquo;A Yak&#257;
having come, seizing me pressed against me for me to roll over on to
the ground. What of that? I did not fall [on account of it]. After you
two fired, indeed, I fell. Then the Yak&#257; bounded off, and went
away. Well, I don&rsquo;t know anything after that. Whether you came
and lifted me up, or what, I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man having recovered from that, again the Yak&#257; came, and
having possessed the man he began to have the powers conferred by
&ldquo;possession.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4259src" href=
"#xd26e4259" name="xd26e4259src">4</a> Afterwards that Yaksa
Vedar&#257;la having come again, and given the Yak&#257; many offerings
placed on frames (<i lang="si-latn">dola pi&#7693;&#275;ni</i>), the
Yak&#257; went out of the way. The man remained very well
[afterwards].</p>

<h2 class="main">Concerning a Man and Two Yak&#257;s</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there was a man who had cut a
chena. The man, without any one joining with him, went one day and made
ready to cut a fresh chena at a place where there was a large tree.</p>
<p>Then the Yak&#257; who dwelt in the tree became afraid, and having
descended to the ground, and having said, &ldquo;Lord, do not cut a
chena here. At every eventide I will bring and give you rice, coconuts,
chillies, etc.,&rdquo; he made obeisance. The man said, &ldquo;It is
good,&rdquo; and went home.</p>
<p>That very evening the Yak&#257; brought and gave him rice and all
things sufficient for curries, and went away. After that, in no long
time the man became in a good position and wealthy, through the
Yak&#257;&rsquo;s bringing him his provisions.</p>
<p>When coming afterwards, the Yak&#257; met another Yak&#257;, who
asked, &ldquo;Where are you taking those things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yak&#257; replied, &ldquo;A man came to cut the residence in
which I stay. On account of it, I promised to give him food and
goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Yak&#257; said, &ldquo;Do thou give the things to-day only.
I will kill the man to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Yak&#257; said, &ldquo;It is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following day, when the man of that house was going somewhere
or other, the Yak&#257; who said, &ldquo;I will kill him,&rdquo; came
to the house, and having crept under the bed remained there. At that
time the man returned, and sitting on the bed, said to his wife,
&ldquo;Bola, I am hungry enough to eat a Yak&#257;.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span></p>
<p>His wife had placed the knife on the shelf, and having plucked a
pine-apple had put it under the bed. The woman [not seeing the
Yak&#257;], said, &ldquo;Look there! On the shelf. Look there! Under
the bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the man, taking the knife that was on the shelf, went near the
bed to get the pine-apple. Then the Yak&#257;, thinking he was coming
to kill and eat him, said, &ldquo;Lord, do not eat me. I will bring and
give you each month anything you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the man saying, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; sent away the
Yak&#257;.</p>
<p>Then the Yak&#257; met that other Yak&#257;, and said, &ldquo;When I
went to set you free I also was caught. Both of us are in the same
state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that he gave the things monthly. Then this man having become a
great wealthy person, remained so.</p>

<p class="first">In a variant in <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of

Bh&#363;ta (evil spirit) who was going to eat him, by threatening to
put him in his bag. He took out his looking-glass, and showed the
Bh&#363;ta his reflection, which the evil spirit thought was another
imprisoned one. The Bh&#363;ta promised to obey the barber&rsquo;s
orders, and provided money, and a granary filled with paddy. The

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country, as a man was going through the
middle of a city he met a man of the city, and asked him, &ldquo;In
what manner does the King of this city rule?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;It does not appear to us that he has any
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man said [sarcastically]: &ldquo;Does the King of this city
know these three matters&mdash;the centre of this country, the number
of the stars in the sky, and the work which the King of the world of
the D&#275;vas<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4330src" href="#xd26e4330"
name="xd26e4330src">2</a> does?&rdquo; Having asked this, that wicked
man went through the midst of the city.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the man of the city came to the palace, and declared to
the King that there were three matters regarding which a man had wanted
information. After he had informed him, the King asked, &ldquo;What are
the three matters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;The centre of the country, the number of the
stars in the sky, and the work which the King of the world of the
D&#275;vas does; these three matters,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the King, having caused the
Ra&#7789;&#275;mahatmay&#257;s&mdash;(the highest provincial
Chiefs)&mdash;to be told that he ordered them to come, after he had
asked them concerning these three matters, the Chiefs said that they
could not tell him the answers. When they said that, the king commanded
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>that the Ra&#7789;&#275;mahatmay&#257;s should
be beheaded. Thereupon the executioners came and beheaded them.</p>
<p>After that, he caused the Adik&#257;ramas&mdash;(the
Ministers)&mdash;to be brought, and asked them if they knew these three
matters. Those persons also said that they could not explain them. He
commanded that party also to be beheaded, and the executioners came and
beheaded them.</p>
<p>Having beheaded all the people of both parties, there remained still
the Royal Preceptor<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4345src" href=
"#xd26e4345" name="xd26e4345src">3</a> only, so he caused the Royal
Preceptor to be brought, and asked him regarding these matters. Then
the Royal Preceptor said, &ldquo;I cannot tell you about them to-day. I
will tell you to-morrow.&rdquo; After he had said this he returned to
his house, and having come there, lying down prone on the bed he
remained without speaking a word.</p>
<p>The youth who looked after the Royal Preceptor&rsquo;s goats came at
that time, and asked, &ldquo;For what reason are you lying down,
Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Royal Preceptor said, &ldquo;They beheaded the Adik&#257;rama
party and the <span class="corr" id="xd26e4357" title=
"Source: Ra&#7789;&#275;mahatmaya">Ra&#7789;&#275;mahatmay&#257;</span>
party to-day; they will behead me to-morrow. The post that I have told
thee of [under the executioner] will be made over to one&rsquo;s
self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth said, &ldquo;Lord, you must tell me the reasons for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Royal Preceptor replied, &ldquo;If I should be unable to-morrow
to say which is the centre of the country, the number of the stars, and
the work which the God of the world of the D&#275;vas does, they will
behead me to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the youth said, &ldquo;Are you so much troubled about that? I
will say those very things for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, at the time when the Royal Preceptor, on the morning of
the following day, was setting off to go to the palace, he called the
youth, and went with him to the palace. The King asked for the answers
to these three sayings. Then the Royal Preceptor said, &ldquo;What is
there in these for me to tell you? Even the youth who looks after
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>the goats for me knows those three
sayings.&rdquo; Then he told the youth to come forward, and the youth
came near the King.</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;Dost thou know the centre of the country, and
the number of the stars, and the work which the God of the world of the
D&#275;vas does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth fixed a stick in the ground, and showed it. &ldquo;Behold!
Here is the centre of one&rsquo;s country. Measure from the four
quarters, and after you have looked at the account, if it should not be
correct be good enough to behead me,&rdquo; he said. The King lost over
that.</p>
<p>Then he told him to say the number of the stars in the sky. Throwing
down on the ground the goat-skin that he was wearing, &ldquo;Count
these hairs, and count the stars in the sky. Should they not be equal
be good enough to behead me,&rdquo; he said. The King lost over that
also.</p>
<p>Thirdly, he told him to say what work the God of the world of the
D&#275;vas does.</p>
<p>The youth said, &ldquo;I will not say it thus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;If so, how will you say it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth said, &ldquo;Should you decorate me with the Royal
Insignia, and put on me the Crown, and give the Sword into my hands,
and place me on the Lion-throne, I will say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King, having caused that youth to bathe, and having
decorated him, placed him upon the Lion-throne.</p>
<p>After that, he called the executioners, and said to them,
&ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! This one beheaded so many [innocent] people;
because of that take him and go, and having beheaded him, cast him out.
Behold! That indeed is the work which the King of the world of the
D&#275;vas does,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thus, having killed the foolish King, the youth who looked after the
goats obtained the sovereignty; and ruling the kingdom together with
the Royal Preceptor, he remained there in prosperity.</p>

<p class="first">The dramatic, and apparently improbable, ending of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>this Kandian story is founded upon an historical
fact. It is recorded in the Mah&#257;vansa, the Sinhalese history (Part
I, chapter 35), that King Yasal&#257;laka-Tissa, who reigned in Ceylon
from 52 to 60 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, had a young gate porter or
messenger called Subha, who closely resembled him in appearance. The
Mah&#257;vansa relates the story of the King&rsquo;s deposition by him
as follows (Turnour&rsquo;s translation):&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The monarch Yasal&#257;laka, in a merry mood, having decked
out the said Subha, the messenger, in the vestments of royalty, and
seated him on the throne, putting the livery bonnet of the messenger on
his own head, stationed himself at a palace gate, with the
porter&rsquo;s staff in his hand. While the ministers of state were
bowing down to him who was seated on the throne, the King was enjoying
the deception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was in the habit, from time to time, of indulging in these
scenes. On a certain occasion (when this farce was repeated),
addressing himself to the merry monarch, the messenger exclaimed:
&lsquo;How does that messenger dare to laugh in my presence?&rsquo; and
succeeded in getting the King put to death. The messenger Subha thus
usurped the sovereignty, and administered it for six years.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>A variant was related to me by the resident monk at a Buddhist
temple to the south of Colombo. Its tenour was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Four Difficult
Questions.</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A certain King put four questions to a Sangha-raja, or
Superior of the Buddhist monks. The first one was, &ldquo;How deep is
the sea?&rdquo; the second, &ldquo;How many stars are there?&rdquo; the
third, &ldquo;Which is the centre of the earth?&rdquo; and fourthly, he
must tell the King what he, the King, thought. The Sangha-raja was
allowed a certain time in which to find answers to the questions.</p>
<p>One day a monk seeing him sad, asked him the reason, and was told
that the King had put these questions to him, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>and
had threatened to take his life if he could not answer them.</p>
<p>The monk told him not to have any fear, and said that he would go on
the appointed day, and answer the King. When the day came round, the
monk dressed himself in the Sangha-raja&rsquo;s robes, and appeared
before the King, saying that he was ready to answer the questions.</p>
<p>The King asked him, &ldquo;How deep is the sea?&rdquo; He replied,
&ldquo;At first it is knee-deep; as you go on it is waist-deep; further
on it is up to the neck; and beyond that it is over the head.&rdquo;
The King was satisfied.</p>
<p>He next asked, &ldquo;How many stars are there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Twenty
lakshas (two millions),&rdquo; said the monk. &ldquo;If you do not
believe it, count them.&rdquo; With this answer, also, the King was
satisfied.</p>
<p>He then inquired, &ldquo;Where is the centre of the earth?&rdquo;
The monk took a staff which he had brought with him, and fixed it
upright in the ground. &ldquo;Here is the centre,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Measure each way from it, and you will find the distance the
same.&rdquo; The King was satisfied with this answer also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lastly, you must tell me what I am thinking,&rdquo; the King
said. The monk replied, &ldquo;You think I am the Sangha-raja, but I am
only one of his monks.&rdquo; So the four questions were all answered
satisfactorily.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>I heard the following version in Cairo:&mdash;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>A certain King said to his Chief Minister, &ldquo;Find me a man who
can measure the world and show me the centre of it, and who can count
me the number of the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister considered the matter carefully, but could think of no
way of complying with the King&rsquo;s orders. At last his wife said,
&ldquo;I can see that something is troubling you. Tell me what it is;
perhaps I can assist you.&rdquo; Then he told her the orders of the
King, and that he did not know where to look for any one who could do
what the King desired. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to the
coffee-dealer&rsquo;s shop. You will find there a man who is always
taking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>hashish. He may be able to help you&rdquo; [his
mental powers being exalted by the drug].</p>
<p>So he went to the coffee-dealer&rsquo;s, and told the hashish-eater
his difficulty. &ldquo;I can soon solve these questions for you,&rdquo;
replied the hashish-eater. &ldquo;Take me to the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon they proceeded to the palace, and the Minister introduced
the hashish-eater to the King. He came with a donkey, which was drawing
a great load of rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First show me the centre of the world,&rdquo; said the
King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place is the centre,&rdquo; said the hashish-eater.
&ldquo;If you doubt it, send your men to drag the other end of this
rope up to the sky, and I will prove to you that you are just in the
middle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;that is a
satisfactory answer. Now give me the number of the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let your people count the hairs on my donkey. You will find
that they are exactly equal to the stars in number,&rdquo; said the
man. The King admitted that he could not prove that he was answered
incorrectly.</p>

</div>
<div class="div2 section storyNotes"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The English version is given in the ballad termed
&ldquo;King John and the Abbot of Canterbury,&rdquo; and is found in
Bishop Percy&rsquo;s <span class="bibl"><i>Reliques of Ancient English
Poetry</i> (ed. 1844, ii, 328)</span>. I give some extracts, etc., for
the benefit of readers in Ceylon, because of its resemblance to the
second Sinhalese story.</p>
<p>With a view to seizing the Abbot&rsquo;s wealth, the King put three
questions to him, the penalty for failing to answer them being
beheading. The Abbot received three weeks&rsquo; grace in which to
discover the replies, but the wisest doctors could not assist him:</p>
<div lang="en" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Away rode the Abbot all sad at that word;</p>
<p class="line">And he rode to Cambridge and Oxenforde;</p>
<p class="line">But never a doctor there was so wise,</p>
<p class="line">That could with his learning an answer devise.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">However, as in the Kandian version, the shepherd came

<h2 class="main">The Faithless Princess</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there is a Prince, it is said.
The Prince, saying that women are faithless, does not marry.</p>
<p>The God &#346;akra having ascertained this, came in the appearance
of a man, and asked at the hand of the Prince whether if he created a
Princess out of his own very body, and gave her to him, he would be
willing to take her in marriage. The Prince said, &ldquo;It is
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the God &#346;akra created a Princess from the
Prince&rsquo;s body, and gave her to him.</p>
<p>When the Prince and Princess, having got married, had been living
together for a very long time, the Princess associated with a
N&#257;gay&#257;.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4574src" href="#xd26e4574"
name="xd26e4574src">1</a> When they had been thus for a long time, the
Princess and the N&#257;gay&#257; spoke together as to how to kill the
Princess&rsquo;s Prince. Then the N&#257;gay&#257; said, &ldquo;Ask at
the hand of the Prince where the Prince&rsquo;s death is. After you
have got to know the place where his death is, I will bite<a class=
"noteref" id="n157.2src" href="#n157.2" name="n157.2src">2</a> him
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Princess asked at the hand of the Prince,
&ldquo;Where is your death?&rdquo; The Prince did not tell her. Every
day the Princess was asking it. On a certain day the Prince said,
&ldquo;To-day my death is in my thumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess told the N&#257;gay&#257;, &ldquo;He said that his
death is in his thumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the N&#257;gay&#257; went [in his snake form, as a cobra], and
stopped on the path on which the Prince was going for his bath, in
order to bite<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n157.2">2</a> him.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>Afterwards, the Prince&rsquo;s people went first; the Prince went in
the middle. Then the people who went first saw the N&#257;gay&#257;,
and killed it.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the people and the Prince having returned from bathing,
the Prince told at the hand of the Princess, &ldquo;As we were going to
bathe to-day a cobra was on the path; my people killed it.&rdquo; The
Princess, clasping her hands with grief, asked, &ldquo;Where was
it?&rdquo; The Prince told her of the place where the cobra was
staying, and she knew that it was the N&#257;gay&#257;.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Princess having given gold to the goldsmith, and
having got a waist-chain made, told him to make a case for it. The
goldsmith made it, and gave it. Then the Princess went to the place
where the cobra was, and cut off its hood; and placing the cobra in the
case of the golden waist-chain, the Princess put it round her
waist.</p>
<p>Having it there, when they had eaten and drunk in the evening, and
lighted the lamp in the house, both of them went into the house.</p>
<p>Then the Princess said to the Prince, &ldquo;I will ask you a
riddle. Should you be unable to explain it, I will kill you. Should you
explain it, you shall kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and both of them swore
it.</p>
<p>The Princess saying,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The N&#257;ga belt</p>
<p class="line">(Is) the golden waist-chain.</p>
<p class="line">Explain (it), friend.</p>

<div lang="si-latn" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>N&#257;ga pa&#7789;iya</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Ran hawa&#7693;iya.</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>T&#333;ra, sakiya.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">told the Prince to solve it. For fifteen
p&#257;&#275;yas (six hours), without extinguishing the lamp, he tried
and tried to explain it. He could not. So she was to kill the Prince
next day.</p>
<p>A D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; (godling) who drank the smoke of the lamp
of that house, was there looking on [invisibly] until the lamp was
extinguished. After the lamp was put out, having drunk a little smoke,
he took a little that was only slightly burnt with him for his wife.
The D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; and D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299; lived in an
Ironwood tree on the roadside.</p>
<p>This Prince&rsquo;s elder sister, and the man to whom she was given
in marriage, having set off to come to the Prince&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>city, stayed that night at the resting-place
under the Ironwood tree.</p>
<p>Then that D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; having brought a little of the
under-burnt smoke of the lamp, after he had given it to the
D&#275;vat&#257;w&#299; she quarrelled with him until fifteen
p&#257;&#275;yas (six hours) had gone, saying, &ldquo;Where have you
been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; said, &ldquo;Do not quarrel. In such and
such a city, such and such a Prince&rsquo;s Princess having associated
with a N&#257;gay&#257;, the Prince&rsquo;s people killed the
N&#257;gay&#257;. Having cut off the N&#257;gay&#257;&rsquo;s hood, and
laid aside her golden waist-chain, putting it round her waist in order
to kill the Prince, because of her anger at the killing of the
N&#257;gay&#257;, the Princess told a riddle to the Prince. Having
sworn that should the Prince be unable to solve it she is to kill the
Prince: should he solve it he is to kill the Princess, the Princess
said,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The N&#257;ga belt</p>
<p class="line">Is the golden waist-chain.</p>
<p class="line">Explain it, friend.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;From the evening, without extinguishing the
lamp, he tried to solve it. The Prince could not explain it. After
fifteen p&#257;&#275;yas had gone by, he put out the light. Up to the
very time when he extinguished the lamp, so long I remained there. She
said that she will kill the Prince to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing it, there stayed below the Ironwood tree the Prince&rsquo;s
elder sister, and the man to whom she was given. After having heard it,
as it became light, when they were coming along to the Prince&rsquo;s
house, they saw from afar that they were going to behead the Prince.
The elder sister said from afar, &ldquo;&#256;! Don&rsquo;t behead him.
I will solve that riddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having come near, the Prince&rsquo;s elder sister explained the
riddle in the manner stated by the D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257;. So the
Prince was saved, and they beheaded the Princess.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Prince who did not go to School</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there is a King, it is said, and
there are two Princes of the King. The two Princes are sent to school,
and as they are going from the palace the two go along together. After
they have walked a little way, the younger brother goes along the path
to the school, and having arrived at the school, learns his letters and
returns home. The elder brother, after playing and playing in the water
of the river, puts the school aside, it is said; and having come round
that way and joined the younger brother, again comes to the palace with
him.</p>
<p>After many days had gone by in that manner, the King one day told
the two Princes, &ldquo;To-day I must look at your lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger brother said, &ldquo;Father-King, I indeed go to the
school, and having said my lessons return. Elder brother and I having
met here, and set off together, after we have gone part of the way,
where elder brother goes I do not know. Having gone somewhere or other,
when I have left the school and am returning, elder brother meets me on
the road, and we two come again to the palace. I can say my lessons;
elder brother indeed cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King looked into the lessons of the two Princes.
When he looked, the younger Prince&rsquo;s lessons were good. When he
asked the elder Prince, he knew nothing. So the King settled to behead
the elder Prince.</p>
<p>The King had, besides, a Prince older than that Prince. He said to
that elder Prince, &ldquo;Behead this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince having taken a sword to the chena <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>jungle, and killed a &ldquo;Blood-sucker&rdquo;
lizard (<i>Calotes</i> sp.), returned after rubbing the blood on the
sword, and showed it to the King. &ldquo;Behold! Father-King, I cut
younger brother,&rdquo; he said. Afterwards their mother having cooked
a bundle of rice, and given it, and also a sword, to the Prince who was
ordered to be beheaded, said, &ldquo;Go to any place you
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Prince was going away taking the bundle of cooked rice and
the sword, he met with a man. The man having uprooted Palmira trees and
Coconut trees, was taking them away and tying a fence. Having seen
this, the Prince said to that man, &ldquo;Come thou and go with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man having said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; as the two persons were
going along together, another man was cutting the earthen ridges in a
rice field. The blade of the man&rsquo;s digging hoe was as large as a
liyadda (one of the squares into which the rice field was divided).
Having seen that, the Prince said to that man who was cutting the ridge
in the field, &ldquo;Come thou and go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man having said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and laid down his digging
hoe at that very place, came away with those two persons. As the three
were going along together, they saw yet a man ploughing. Having seen
that the man ploughed a liyadda at one ploughing (furrow), the Prince
said, &ldquo;Come thou and go with me.&rdquo; The man said
&ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and laying down his plough at that very place,
went with the three persons. The three persons whom the Prince had met
with on the way were three giants.</p>
<p>The four persons having gone on and on, went near the house of a
R&#257;kshas&#299; at a city. Sitting down there, the Prince said to
one of the giants, &ldquo;There! Go to that house and bring thou
cooking pots and fire.&rdquo; So that giant went to the house of the
R&#257;kshas&#299;.</p>
<p>As he arrived there, the R&#257;kshas&#299; was pouring water over
(i.e. bathing) a child. The giant went near the R&#257;kshas&#299;, and
said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Give me fire and cooking pots.&rdquo; The
R&#257;kshas&#299; told him the way to the house in which she ate human
flesh, and said, &ldquo;There! They are in that house; take
them.&rdquo; After that, at the time when the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>giant was going into the house, the
R&#257;kshas&#299; went running and shut the door, so that the giant
could not come out.</p>
<p>Those two giants and the Prince remained a long time looking out;
the giant did not come. Afterwards the Prince again told a giant to go.
The giant having gone, asked the R&#257;kshas&#299;,
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t a man come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshas&#299; said, &ldquo;He did not come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the giant said, &ldquo;If so, give me cooking pots and
fire.&rdquo; Then the R&#257;kshas&#299;, in the same manner in which
she told that giant, showed him the way to the house in which she ate
human flesh. As the giant was going into the house, the
R&#257;kshas&#299;, having gone running, shut the door.</p>
<p>That Prince and the third giant having been there a long time,
neither of the giants came. Afterwards the Prince told the other giant
to go. The giant went, and asked the R&#257;kshas&#299;,
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t two men come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshas&#299; said, &ldquo;They did not come
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the giant said, &ldquo;If so, give me cooking pots and
fire.&rdquo; The R&#257;kshas&#299;, in that very way having told him
the path to the house in which she ate human flesh, at the time when
the giant was going into it shut the door.</p>
<p>The Prince remained looking out for a long time; the three giants
did not come. Afterwards the Prince, taking his sword, came near the
R&#257;kshas&#299;, and asked, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t three men come
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshas&#299; said, &ldquo;They did not come
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince, seizing the R&#257;kshas&#299;&rsquo;s hair knot,
prepared to chop at her with the sword. &ldquo;Give me quickly my three
men; if not, I shall chop thy head off,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshas&#299;, saying, &ldquo;An&#275;! Do not kill
me. At any place where you want it I will assist you,&rdquo; gave him
the three men.</p>
<p>After that, the Prince and the three giants having gone away without
killing the R&#257;kshas&#299;, the Prince caused the three giants to
stay at a city; and having given into their hands a Blue-lotus flower,
said, &ldquo;Should I not be alive, this Blue-lotus flower will fade,
and the lime trees at your house will die.&rdquo; So saying, the
Prince, taking his sword, went quite alone. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>After going a long way he came to a city, and having gone to the
house of a R&#257;kshasa, when he looked, the R&#257;kshasa had gone
for human flesh as food and only a girl was there. The Prince asked the
girl for a resting-place.</p>
<p>The girl said, &ldquo;An&#275;! What have you come here for? A
R&#257;kshasa lives at this house. The R&#257;kshasa having eaten the
men of this city they are now finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I will kill him. Are there dried coconuts
and men&#275;ri<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4741src" href="#xd26e4741"
name="xd26e4741src">1</a> here?&rdquo; The girl said there were. The
Prince told her to bring them, and the girl brought them.</p>
<p>Then the Prince asked, &ldquo;How does he come to eat
men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl said, &ldquo;Having come twelve miles&mdash;(three
gawwas)&mdash;away, he cries, &lsquo;H&#363;&rsquo;; having come eight
miles away, he cries, &lsquo;H&#363;&rsquo;; and having come four miles
away, he cries, &lsquo;H&#363;&rsquo;; and then he comes to this
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Prince having spread out, from the stile at the
fence, the men&#275;ri seed and the dried coconuts, over the whole of
the open ground near the front of the house, went to sleep in the
veranda, placing the sword near him, and laying his head on the waist
pocket of the girl.</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa, when twelve miles away, cried,
&ldquo;H&#363;.&rdquo; Tears fell from the girl&rsquo;s eyes, and
dropped on the Prince&rsquo;s head. The Prince arose, and said to the
girl, &ldquo;What are you weeping for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa cried, &ldquo;H&#363;,&rdquo; eight miles
away. The girl said, &ldquo;There! The R&#257;kshasa cried,
&lsquo;H&#363;,&rsquo; eight miles away.&rdquo; Continuing to say,
&ldquo;He will cry, &lsquo;H&#363;,&rsquo; the next time, and then come
here,&rdquo; the girl wept.</p>
<p>The Prince, having told the girl not to weep, took the sword in his
hand, and while he was there the R&#257;kshasa, crying
&ldquo;H&#363;,&rdquo; came into the open space near the house.</p>
<p>Then the Prince chopped at the R&#257;kshasa with his sword, and the
R&#257;kshasa went backward. Thereupon the Prince said, &ldquo;Will not
even the R&#257;kshas&#299; whom I set free that day without killing
her, render assistance in this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshas&#299; came immediately, and struck a thorn into the
crown of the R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s head, and at that very instant
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>the R&#257;kshasa died. After that, the Prince
buried the body, and marrying the girl remained there.</p>
<p>When he had been there a long time, a widow-mother came and said to
the Prince and the girl, &ldquo;Children, I will come and live with
you, as you are alone.&rdquo; Both of them said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo;
so the woman stayed there.</p>
<p>After she had lived there a long time, the woman said to the girl,
&ldquo;Daughter, ask in what place is the life of the
Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the girl said to the Prince, &ldquo;Mother is asking
where your life is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;My life is in my neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl told the woman, &ldquo;I asked him; he said his life is in
his neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;It is not in the neck. He is speaking
falsely. Ask again.&rdquo; So the girl asked again.</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;My life is in my breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl told the woman, &ldquo;He said it is in his
breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;It is not in the breast. Tell him to speak
the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards she said again to the Prince, &ldquo;Mother says it is
not in your breast. She said that you are to speak the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;My life is in my sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the girl told the widow-mother, &ldquo;He said it is in his
sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a long time had gone by, one day the Prince, laying down the
sword, went to sleep. After the Prince had gone to sleep, the widow
woman and that girl having quietly taken the sword, put it in the fire
on the hearth. Then as the sword burnt and burnt away the Prince
died.</p>
<p>After that, the widow woman took the girl, and gave her to the King,
and the woman also stayed at the palace.</p>
<p>Then the Blue-lotus flower which the Prince gave to those three
giants on going away, faded, and the lime trees died. When the giants
saw this they said, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Our elder brother will have
died,&rdquo; and having spoken together, the three giants came to seek
the Prince.</p>
<p>Having come there, and asked the men of the city at which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>the Prince stayed, regarding him, they went to
the house in which he lived, and searched for him. As they were digging
in a heap of rubbish, they found that a little bit of the end of the
sword was there, and they took it. Afterwards the giants placed it on a
bed, and after they had tended it carefully, the sword little by little
became larger. When the sword became completely restored, the Prince
was created afresh.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the Prince looked to see if the girl whom he had
taken in marriage was there, neither the girl nor the widow-mother was
there. Then the Prince went with the three giants to the King&rsquo;s
palace, and on looking there they learnt that the girl was married to
the King, and that the widow woman also was there. So the Prince said
to the widow woman, &ldquo;Quickly give me the Princess whom I
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;An&#275;! The Princess whom I knew is not
here. She did not come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince cut off the woman&rsquo;s head with his sword, and
having gone to the King, asked, &ldquo;Where is my Princess<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e4809" title="Source: .">?</span> You must give her to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;No Princess will be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Prince cut off the King&rsquo;s head with his sword;
and he and the three giants having cut down all the servants who were
in the palace, summoning the Princess, remained in that very
palace.</p>

<p class="first">The giving a plant or flower as a life index, which
fades when illness or danger besets the giver, and dies at his death,
is a very common incident in folk-tales.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Wide-Awake Stories</i> (Steel and Temple),
p. 52</span>&mdash;<span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Punjab</i>
(Steel), p. 47</span>&mdash;it was a barley plant.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of Bengal</i> (Day), p.
189</span>, a Prince planted a tree as his life index, and said,
&ldquo;When you see the tree green and fresh then you know that it is
well with me; when you see the tree fade in some parts, then you know
that I am in an ill case; and when you see the whole tree fade, then
know that I am dead and gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Tot&#257; Kah&#257;n&#299;</i> (Small), p.
43</span>, when a man was about to leave his wife, she gave him a
nosegay of flowers which would retain their freshness if she were
faithful to him, and fade if she misconducted herself.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. xvii, p.
54</span>, a plant was given to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166"
href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>each of two persons, as a
Prince&rsquo;s life index. He said, &ldquo;If this plant should fade,
know that I am sick or in danger; if it should die know that I also am
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>The notion that a person&rsquo;s life may be concealed in some
external object, usually a bird or a bee, is one of the commonest
features of folk-tales.</p>
<p>In the story numbered 24 in this volume, the King&rsquo;s life was
in a golden parrot.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Wide-Awake Stories</i>, p.
59</span>&mdash;<span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Punjab</i>, p.
52</span>&mdash;a Jinni&rsquo;s life was in a bee, which was in a
golden cage inside the crop (?) of a Maina [bird].</p>
<p>At pp. 62, 63, <span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Punjab</i>, p.
55</span>, a Prince&rsquo;s life was in his sword. When this was placed
in the fire he felt a burning fever, and when it was made red-hot and a
rivet came out of the hilt, his head came off. Afterwards, when the
sword was repaired and repolished, the Prince was restored to life.</p>
<p>At p. 83, <span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Punjab</i>, p.
75</span>, the life of a Princess was in a nine-lakh necklace, which
was in a box inside a bee that lived in the body of a fish. When asked
about it, she first said that her life was in each of the seven sons of
the wicked Queen who wanted to kill her, all of whom were murdered by
the Queen.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd
ed., p. 49</span>, the lives of R&#257;kshasas were in seven cocks, a
spinning-wheel, a pigeon, and a starling.</p>
<p>At p. 134, the life of one was in a veranda pillar at his house;
when it was broken he died.</p>
<p>At p. 383, the life of one was in a queen-bee in a honey-comb
hanging on a tree.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of Bengal</i> (Day), pp. 2 and
6</span>, the life of a Prince was in a golden necklace deposited in a
wooden box which was in the heart of a fish.</p>
<p>At pp. 85 and 86, the lives of seven hundred R&#257;kshasas were in
two bees which were on the top of a crystal pillar, deep in the water
of a tank. If a drop of their blood fell on the ground, a thousand
R&#257;kshasas would start up from it.</p>
<p>At p. 121, the life of a R&#257;kshas&#299; was in a bird that was
in a cage. As its limbs were torn off, a corresponding limb dropped off
the R&#257;kshas&#299; who had been made the Queen.</p>
<p>At p. 253, the lives of two R&#257;kshasas (m. and f.) were in two
bees that were in a wooden box at the bottom of a tank. If a person who
killed them allowed a drop of their blood to fall on the ground, he
would be torn into seven hundred pieces by the R&#257;kshasas.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. i, p.
86</span>, in a Dardu legend (G. W. Leitner), the life of a King of
Gilgit was in snow, and he could only die by fire.</p>
<p>At p. 117, in a Bengal story (G. H. Damant), the lives of
R&#257;kshasas <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>were in two bees in a gourd which was inside a
crystal pillar at the bottom of a tank. If one drop of the bees&rsquo;
blood fell on the ground, the R&#257;kshasas would be twice as numerous
as before. The bees were killed by being squeezed to death.</p>
<p>At p. 171, in a Bengal story (G. H. Damant), the lives of
R&#257;kshasas were in a lemon, and a bird. When the lemon was cut in
Bengal, the R&#257;kshasas in Ceylon died. As the bird&rsquo;s wings
were broken, the R&#257;kshas&#299; Queen&rsquo;s arms were broken;
when the bird died, she died.</p>
<p>In vol. xvi, p. 191, the life of a giant was in a parrot; when it
was killed he died.</p>
<p>In vol. xvii, p. 51, a Prince&rsquo;s life was in a sword; if it
rusted he was sick, and if it broke he died.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of Hindustan</i>, Allahabad
(Shaik Chilli), p. 51</span>, the life of a Prince was in the
brightness of his sword. When it was placed in a furnace and lost the
brightness, he died. A giant who was his friend found it, and
discovering that a little brightness remained at the tip, rubbed it
until it regained its lustre, on which the Prince revived.</p>
<p>At p. 114, the lives of R&#257;kshasas were in a number of birds;
they died when these were killed.</p>
<p>In a tale of the interior of W. Africa in <i lang="fr">Contes
Soudanais</i> (C. Monteil), p. 154, the life of a King was in a little
box inside a small goat-skin, which was in a little pot placed inside a
large pot. When the King was told this he died.</p>
<p>Doubtless this strange notion of a life safeguarded by being hidden
away, is of early date, and may be due originally to the early magical
idea prevalent in Egypt, Assyria, and India, that a person might be
killed from any distance by piercing the heart of a figurine formed to
represent him. This action is mentioned in the Commentary on the
<span class="bibl"><i>Atharva Veda</i> (Bloomfield&rsquo;s translation,
p. 359)</span>; and in the <span class="bibl"><i>Rigveda</i>, i, 29, 7
(Griffith&rsquo;s translation)</span>, prayer is made to Indra for the
destruction of &ldquo;him who in secret injures us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl">J&#257;taka story No. 208 (vol. ii, p.
111)</span>, a monkey escaped from a crocodile that was going to kill
it in order to get its heart, by telling it that monkeys kept their
hearts hanging on trees.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata</i>, Vana Parva,
135, 52</span>, a <span class="corr" id="xd26e4972" title=
"Source: Rishi">&#7770;ishi</span> caused buffaloes to shatter a
mountain, and thereby killed a child whose life was dependent on its
existence, if not supposed to be actually in it.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>The recovery of the three giants from the house of the
R&#257;kshas&#299; is evidently based on the story of Wijaya, the first
King of Ceylon, and Kuw&#275;n&#299;, a female Yakkha or aboriginal
Princess, who, taking the form of a devotee, had captured his followers
one by one, and imprisoned them.</p>
<p>The story is given in the Mah&#257;vansa, chapter vii, as
follows:&mdash;<span class="corr" id="xd26e4981" title=
"Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>All these persons not returning, Wijaya
becoming alarmed, equipping <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href=
"#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>himself with the five weapons of
war, proceeded after them; and examining the delightful pond [to which
they had gone to bathe], he could perceive footsteps leading down only
into the tank; and he there saw the devotee. It occurred to him:
&lsquo;My retinue must surely have been seized by her.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Woman, hast thou seen my attendants?&rsquo; said he.
&lsquo;Prince,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;what need hast thou of
attendants? Do drink and bathe ere thou departest.&rsquo; Saying to
himself, &lsquo;Even my lineage, this Yakkhin&#299; is acquainted with
it,&rsquo; proclaiming his title, and quickly seizing his bow, he
rushed at her. Securing the Yakkhin&#299; by the throat with a
&lsquo;n&#257;r&#257;cana&rsquo; ring, with his left hand seizing her
by the hair, and raising his sword with his right hand, he exclaimed,
&lsquo;Slave! restore me my followers, or I will put thee to
death.&rsquo; The Yakkhin&#299;, terrified, implored that her life
might be spared. &lsquo;Lord! spare my life; on thee I will confer this
sovereignty; unto thee I will render the favours of my sex, and every
other service according to thy desire.&rsquo; In order that she might
not prove herself treacherous, he made the Yakkhin&#299; take an oath.
While he was in the act of saying, &lsquo;Instantly produce my
followers,&rsquo; she brought them forth&rdquo; (<span class=
"bibl"><i>Mah&#257;vansa</i>, i, p. 32</span>).</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>The idea of the thorn which was driven into the head of the
R&#257;kshasa, is borrowed from magical practice. In the case of a
figurine made for the destruction or injury of a person, pins or nails
or thorns were run into various parts of the body, one being inserted
in the crown of the head. In a variant of the story numbered 73 in this
work, a female Yak&#257; was kept in subjection by means of an iron
nail that was driven into the crown of the head.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Fairy Tales</i> (Stokes), p.
12</span>, a pin was fixed in the head of a woman who had been
transformed into a bird. When it was drawn out she resumed her human
form.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Illustrated Guide to the South Indian
Railway</i>, 1900, p. 232</span>, it is stated regarding the great
stone Bull, 12 feet high, at the Tanjore temple, that &ldquo;it was
popularly supposed by the natives that this bull was growing, and as
they feared it might become too large for the mandapam [stone canopy]
erected over it a nail was driven into the back of its head, and since
this was done the size of the monolith has remained stationary.&rdquo;

<h2 class="label">No. 21</h2>
<h2 class="main">Nagul-Munn&#257;</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a village there were two persons called
Nagul-Munn&#257; and Mun-ae&#7789;a Guruw&#257;. While those two were
living there they spoke together, &ldquo;Friend, while we two are
remaining in this way matters are not going on properly.&rdquo; At the
time when they spoke thus, Mun-ae&#7789;a Guruw&#257; replied to
Nagul-Munn&#257;&rsquo;s talk, and said, &ldquo;It is good, friend. If
that be so let us two cut a chena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having spoken thus, the two persons went to the chena jungle, and
there being no watch-hut there, built one; and taking supplies week by
week, began to chop down the bushes while they were living at the house
in the jungle. Having chopped down the jungle, and burnt it, and sown
the chena, the millet plants grew to a very large size.</p>
<p>When the two persons were at the watch-hut they remained talking one
night for a long time, and said, &ldquo;To-morrow we must go to the
village to bring back supplies.&rdquo; After talking thus, they went to
sleep, both of them.</p>
<p>During the time while they were sleeping, Mun-ae&#7789;a
Guruw&#257;&rsquo;s clothes caught fire. Then Nagul-Munn&#257; awoke,
and jumped down to the ground, and ran away. Mun-ae&#7789;a Guruw&#257;
was burnt in the shed and died. On account of his being killed, through
fear of being charged with causing his death, Nagul-Munn&#257; bounded
off into the jungle, and did not return to the village.</p>
<p>That day the relatives of those people who were in the village,
thinking, &ldquo;Nagul-Munn&#257; and Mun-ae&#7789;a Guruw&#257; will
be coming to fetch supplies,&rdquo; getting ready the supplies, stayed
looking for them. On that day the two persons did <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>not
come; because they did not come two men went from the village to look
for them.</p>
<p>The two having gone and looked, and seen that the watch-hut had been
burnt, spoke together concerning it: &ldquo;Both these men have been
burnt and died. Let us go back to the village.&rdquo; So they
returned.</p>
<p>Nagul-Munn&#257;, who sprang into the jungle that night, having come
home during the night of the following day, spoke to his wife, who was
in the house. The woman, thinking that he had died, was frightened at
his speech, and cried out, &ldquo;Nagul-Munn&#257; has been born as a
Yak&#257;, and having come here is doing something to me.&rdquo; At
that cry the men of the village came running; when they looked he was
not there, having run off through fear of being seized.</p>
<p>In that manner he came on two days. The woman, being afraid, did not
open the door. On the third day he arose, and hid himself at the tank
near the village. While he was there, a tom-tom beater having gone to a
devil-dance,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5033src" href="#xd26e5033"
name="xd26e5033src">1</a> came bringing a bit of cooked rice, and a box
containing his mask and decorations.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5037src" href="#xd26e5037" name="xd26e5037src">2</a></p>
<p>As he was coming along bringing them, this Nagul-Munn&#257; having
seen him, went and beat the tom-tom beater, and taking the bit of
cooked rice and the box of devil-dancer&rsquo;s things, bounded into
the jungle. Having sprung into the jungle, and eaten the bit of rice,
he unfastened the box of devil-dancer&rsquo;s goods, and taking the
things in it, dressed himself in them, putting the jingling
bracelets<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5043src" href="#xd26e5043" name=
"xd26e5043src">3</a> on his arms and the jingling anklets<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5047src" href="#xd26e5047" name="xd26e5047src">4</a>
on his legs.</p>
<p>There was a large mask in it. Taking it, and tying it on his face,
he went to the village when it became night, and having gone to a house
there, broke the neck of a calf that was tied near it, and sprang into
the rice-field near by. Having made a noise by shaking the jingling
bracelets, and given three cries, &ldquo;H&#363;, H&#363;,
H&#363;,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;If you do not give a leaf-cup of
rice and a young coconut at dawn, and at night a leaf-cup of rice and a
young coconut, I will kill all the cattle and men that are in your
village, and having drunk their blood, go away.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>The men of the village becoming afraid on account of it, began to
give rice every day in the way he said. Having given it for about four
or five years in this manner, the men spoke together, &ldquo;Let us
fetch a sooth-sayer to seize that Yak&#257;.&rdquo; After having said
concerning it, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; they fetched a doctor
(<i lang="si-latn">Ved&#257;</i>).</p>
<p>When the doctor went to the tank to catch that Yak&#257;,
Nagul-Munn&#257; came, and seizing that doctor, cut his bathing cloth,
and having taken him to the place where he was staying, killed him, and
trampled on his bathing cloth. Through the seizing and killing of the
doctor, the men of the village became afraid to a still greater
degree.</p>
<p>After that, having talked about bringing another sooth-sayer they
fetched one. In the same manner, when he went to the tank the Yak&#257;
killed the sooth-sayer. At that deed the men of the village became more
afraid still.</p>
<p>Having fetched a Sanny&#257;si (a Hindu religious mendicant) from
Jaffna, they went to him, and told him to seize the Yak&#257;. That man
said, &ldquo;It is good&rdquo;; and having gone to the aforesaid tank
to look for him, the Yak&#257; was in a tree. So the sooth-sayer
repeated incantations to cause the Yak&#257; to descend. The Yak&#257;
did not descend.</p>
<p>After that, because he did not descend, that person got to know that
he was a man, and on his calling &ldquo;H&#363;,&rdquo; to the men of
the village the men came. Afterwards, seizing Nagul-Munn&#257;, who was
in the tree, they went to the village.</p>
<p>Because Mun-ae&#7789;a Guruw&#257; had died, the relatives of
Mun-ae&#7789;a Guruw&#257; came for their [legal] action against
him.</p>
<p>Saying that he had cheated them, and eaten food wrongly obtained
from them, the men of the village came for their action.</p>
<p>Because he had stolen the rice and the box with tom-tom
beater&rsquo;s things in it, the tom-tom beater came for his
action.</p>
<p>Saying that he killed the first sooth-sayer, his people came for
their action.</p>
<p>The second sooth-sayer&rsquo;s people also in the same way came for
their action.</p>
<p>For his killing the calf the owner came for his action.</p>
<p>After all who had brought these actions had came to one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>spot, the man, saying, &ldquo;Because my wife
told me to cut the chena together with Mun-ae&#7789;a Guruw&#257;, and
through my cutting the chena with him, this happened,&rdquo; killed his
own wife.</p>
<p>Then, while he was going for his trial a bear bit that man on the
way, and he died.</p>

<p class="first">In <span class="bibl"><i>The Orientalist</i>, vol.
iii, p. 31</span>, there is a nearly similar story of a tom-tom beater
who was supposed to be burnt in his watch hut. In reality, it was a
beggar who was burnt. The man being afraid of being charged with
murdering him, got hid in the jungle. He came to his house at night,
but was supposed to be the <i lang="si-latn">Mala upan Yak&#257;</i>,
&ldquo;the evil spirit born from the dead,&rdquo; and was refused
admittance by his wife, who gave an alarm. As men were coming on
hearing it, he ran off. On another night when he came, his wife
assailed him with a volley of invectives, as demon-scarers; so carrying
off his dancing paraphernalia, he again retired, and afterwards robbed
travellers, and frightened the people till they threatened to leave the
district. The King offered a handsome reward for his apprehension, but
he tied up a Ka&#7789;&#7789;a&#7693;iy&#257; or devil priest who came
to exorcise him. In the end he was captured by a Buddhist monk, taken
before the King, and after relating his adventures, appears to have
been allowed to go unpunished.</p>
<p>In the J&#257;taka story No. 257 (vol. ii, p. 209), there is an
account of four actions brought against one man on the same day. It is
a folk-tale in Ceylon also. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href=

without children. The King having performed many meritorious deeds,
five children were born.</p>
<p>When they looked into the <i lang="si-latn">Naekata</i> (or
prognostics resulting from the positions of the planets) at the time
when the children were born, those of four were good, but that of the
fifth child was that on seeing him his father&rsquo;s two eyes would
become blind. The King told them to take the Prince and put him down in
the forest. So having taken the Prince they put him in the forest.</p>
<p>After that, animals having come through the favour of the
Prince&rsquo;s guardian deity, gave him milk, and reared him.</p>
<p>After much time had passed, the Prince&rsquo;s father, the King,
went to have the jungle driven (for shooting); and having gone, while
they were driving the jungle that Prince came, and bounded round the
King&rsquo;s enclosure. Then, the King having seen him his eyes became
blind, and he went away without his eyes seeing anything. The people
who went with the King, lifting him up, carried him to the palace.</p>
<p>Having arrived there, various medical treatments were applied; he
was not cured. After that, he caused sooth-sayers to be brought, and
after he had asked them regarding it, they said, &ldquo;By applying
medical treatment you will not meet with a cure. In the midst of the
Forest of the Gods there is a flower called Kul&#275;-bak&#257;. Having
brought that flower, and burnt it on your eyes, your eyes will
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the King asked the people, &ldquo;Who is able to bring
this flower?&rdquo; All the people said they could not do it. Then the
four eldest Princes of the King, having said, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>&ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; asked permission of the
King; the King told them to go. So the four persons having started,
went.</p>
<p>As they were going, the four persons went to a city. A courtesan
stayed in that city; her name was Diribari-Lak&#257;.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e5129src" href="#xd26e5129" name="xd26e5129src">1</a> She
gambled (i.e. kept a gambling house). These four persons went to her
house, and having gone there prepared to gamble. Then the woman said,
&ldquo;Should you lose by this game, I shall make you four persons
prisoners (that is, slaves).<span class="corr" id="xd26e5132" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> The four persons having said, &ldquo;It
is good,&rdquo; gambled, and all four having lost remained there as
prisoners.</p>
<p>The Prince who was in the forest, having got to know all these
matters, also set off to seek the flower, and on his way arrived at the
city at which the Princes who were made prisoners were staying. This
one, having gone to the King of the city, was appointed to do
messenger&rsquo;s work there. While he was living thus, this one
obtained news that the courtesan was gambling, and thereupon this
Prince asked the King for leave of absence. Having obtained it, he went
to the house of an old woman near the courtesan&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Having gone there, this Prince having fallen down near the feet of
that old woman and made obeisance, weeping and weeping, these words are
what he said, &ldquo;Mother, are you in the enjoyment of health? Do not
you let your face be even visible (to) scrofulous offspring. When
lightning has struck you (may it) take your progeny.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5139src" href="#xd26e5139" name="xd26e5139src">2</a>
Having spoken and spoken with these honours he remained weeping. The
woman&rsquo;s child, not of small age, was there, and having said
similar things to the child also, and while weeping having paid
respect, the woman made that Prince rise, and asked him, &ldquo;Where
were you for such a long period?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was with a King,&rdquo; the Prince said. &ldquo;Mother,
whose is that house?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;Why, son? Do not say anything about it. That
house is the house of a courtesan. There is a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>gambling game of that woman&rsquo;s, and by it
many persons, having lost, remain as prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;Mother, how does one win by that
game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the woman said, &ldquo;A bent lamp having been lighted, is
placed at the gambling place. Below the lamp a cat is sitting. While
the woman is gambling the cat raises its head; then victory falls to
the woman. When another person is playing the cat lowers its head; then
defeat falls to that man. If you are to win, having extinguished the
bent lamp, and driven away the cat, and brought and placed there
another lamp, if you should then play you can win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Prince went to gamble. Having gone there, when he
was ready to gamble she said, &ldquo;Should you lose in gambling, you
will be condemned to imprisonment; should you win you marry
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and gambled. When he was
losing, he extinguished the lamp, and having beaten and driven away the
cat, he told the woman to bring another lamp. After that, the woman
brought a lamp. Having brought and placed the lamp there, they gambled.
The woman having lost all, the Prince won. Afterwards, that woman
married this Prince.</p>
<p>During the time while he was living there, as this Prince was
starting to go and bring the Kul&#275;-bak&#257; flower, the woman
said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I did not come for this gambling; I came for
the Kul&#275;-bak&#257; flower. I must indeed go, after having set off
for this purpose,&rdquo; he said. So the Prince went to bring the
flower. Before this, he had allowed the imprisoned men to go, and said
to the four Princes, &ldquo;Stop until I return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus gone, he entered into the midst of a forest. While he
was there, human-flesh-eating serpents and forest animals that were in
the midst of the forest sprang to devour this Prince, but he made
supplication to his deity, so they were unable to do it, and went
away.</p>
<p>Then the Yak&#257; who was guarding the Kul&#275;-bak&#257; garden,
having seen the Prince, and having arisen and come near <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>the
Prince, asked, &ldquo;Have you, a man born in the world of men, come
into my presence to be a prey to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;My father the King for a fault said he must
behead me. On account of it, having made my way into the midst of the
forest, I have come to you for you to eat indeed. If you are going to
eat me, eat me; if you are going to keep me, keep me alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Yak&#257; asked, &ldquo;What do you eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;We eat wheat flour, gh&#299;, sugar, and
camels&rsquo; flesh.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5183src" href=
"#xd26e5183" name="xd26e5183src">3</a> These indeed we eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All these requisites having been brought by the Yak&#257;, after he
had given them to the Prince, the Prince made the food, and gave to the
Yak&#257; also.</p>
<p>The Yak&#257; having eaten the food, sprang up into the air, and
said to the Prince, &ldquo;I never ate a meal like this. I will do
anything you tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said to the Yak&#257;, &ldquo;Where is the path to
go to the Kul&#275;-bak&#257; garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yak&#257; sprang up into the air, and fell on the ground, and
beating his head, said, &ldquo;If you had said so before this, by this
time I should have eaten you. What can I do now that I have promised to
help you?&rdquo; Having said, &ldquo;Go away from here,&rdquo; he told
him about the path.</p>
<p>Then the Prince went along it. There, also, a Yaksan&#299;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5198src" href="#xd26e5198" name="xd26e5198src">4</a>
(female Yak&#257;) was guarding it, and the Prince came to her. The
Yaksan&#299; asked the Prince, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;Having delayed in the midst of a forest, as
I was returning I was unable to find the country with my village. Now I
have met with you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he appeared good to the Yaksan&#299; she caused him to stay
there, and married her daughter to him. The name of the girl to whom
the Prince was married was Maha-Mud&#257;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5205src" href="#xd26e5205" name="xd26e5205src">5</a></p>
<p>During the time while he was there the Prince remained angry.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>The girl asked, &ldquo;What are you angry for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I must go to look at the Kul&#275;-bak&#257;
garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the girl spoke about this matter to her mother. So that woman
having fetched rats, caused a tunnel to be made by them to the
Kul&#275;-bak&#257; garden. Along that tunnel the Prince went to the
flower garden, and having gone there, and plucked the flowers, came
back again.</p>
<p>Having returned there, calling Maha-Mud&#257; he came to the house
of Diribari-Lak&#257;. Having arrived there, he burnt on the lower part
of the back the four Princes who had remained as prisoners. The Prince
who went for the Kul&#275;-bak&#257; flowers having burnt in this way
the four Princes, who stayed as slaves at the house of
Diribari-Lak&#257;, these four persons were freed from
imprisonment.</p>
<p>Then the Prince, Maha-Mud&#257;, and Diribari-Lak&#257;, taking the
flowers, came to the Prince&rsquo;s native country. Having arrived
there, he burnt the Kul&#275;-bak&#257; flowers on the two eyes of his
father the King, and the two eyes of the King became well.</p>
<p>After that, the King having asked the Prince regarding these
matters, learnt that he was the King&rsquo;s Prince, [and he and his
two wives continued to live there with him].</p>

<h2 class="main">Kurulu-gama Appu, the Sooth-sayer</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city a man was stricken by a scarcity of
food to eat, and he went to another country. Having gone there, during
the time while he was residing in a village, the village men asked,
&ldquo;What sooth can you tell?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5273src" href="#xd26e5273" name="xd26e5273src">1</a> He said,
&ldquo;I can tell one sooth; to do that sooth I want Jak-tree gum,
Coconut oil, and Euphorbia milk&rdquo; (the milky sap which exudes from
cuts or bruises in the bark). Thereupon the men having collected those
things that he mentioned, gave them to him.</p>
<p>Then he went and warmed these things [making bird-lime] and placed
[limed] twigs, and catching birds and coming with them, he gave them
daily, two by two at each house, and thus ate. The man&rsquo;s name was
Appu; his village was Kurulu-gama (Birds&rsquo; village).</p>
<p>While he was continuing to eat in this manner, the men of that
village started to go to Puttalam, carrying produce for sale. That man
also said, &ldquo;I also must go.&rdquo; Then the men of the village
asked, &ldquo;You have nothing; what will you take?&rdquo; Thereupon
this one tying up a pingo load of chaff and coconut husks, goes with
the men.</p>
<p>Then the men who were going on that journey, having come down to the
high road, set off to go. While they were going, the men having said
[in fun] &ldquo;Vedar&#257;la&rdquo; (Doctor) to that man, he kept the
name.</p>
<p>Having gone very far, the Vedar&#257;la, telling the men who went
with him to wait on the road, placed his pingo (carrying-stick) on the
road, and went into an open <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href=
"#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>place in the jungle. While going
along in it, when he looked about, a yoke of cattle were entangled in
the bushes. Then this Vedar&#257;la having gone near the yoke of
cattle, looked at the letter marks branded on them, and having come
back and taken up the pingo load, while they were going on it became
night.</p>
<p>This party having halted on the road near a village, sent the
Vedar&#257;la to get a resting-place for the night. Having gone to a
house in the village, when he asked for it the house men said,
&ldquo;What giving of resting-places is there for us! We are lamenting
in sorrow for the difficulty we are in. Our yoke of cattle are
missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vedar&#257;la said, &ldquo;Now then, what have we to do with
your losing a yoke of cattle? Give us a resting-place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want one, look there! There is the shed, come and stay
there,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>Then the Vedar&#257;la having come back, says to the people of the
party, &ldquo;There is a shed indeed. Stay if you like; go on, if you
want to go,&rdquo; he said. So this party having come to the shed sat
down.</p>
<p>The people of the party said to the Vedar&#257;la,
&ldquo;Vedar&#257;la, why are you staying looking about? Night is
coming on. We must seek a little firewood and water,&rdquo; they spoke
together.</p>
<p>The house persons having heard these words, said, &ldquo;What is
this, that you are saying &lsquo;Vedar&#257;la&rsquo;? Does he know
sooth and the like?&rdquo; they asked.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5302src" href="#xd26e5302" name="xd26e5302src">2</a></p>
<p>The persons of the party said without a reason for it (<i lang=
"si-latn">nikama&#7789;a</i>), &ldquo;To a certain extent he can tell
matters of sooth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, don&rsquo;t be delayed on account of anything you
want. We will bring and give you rice, firewood, and water.&rdquo; So
they brought and gave them five quarts of rice, a dried fish, a head of
ash-plantains.</p>
<p>This party, cooking amply, and having eaten, said at night to the
person who owned the house, &ldquo;Now then, bring a packet of betel
leaves for him to tell you sooth.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>So the house person
having brought the betel, gave it to the Vedar&#257;la.</p>
<p>Thereupon the assumed (<i>lit.</i> &ldquo;face&rdquo;)
Vedar&#257;la, having taken the betel, after having looked at it
falsely becoming &ldquo;possessed,&rdquo; said, &ldquo;It is a yoke of
oxen of yours that have been lost, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the house person said, &ldquo;You have said the sooth very
correctly. I asked it of the deities of many d&#275;w&#257;las
(demon-temples), and of sooth-sayers. There wasn&rsquo;t a person who
told me even a sign of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereafter the Vedar&#257;la asked, &ldquo;What will you give me for
seeking and giving you the yoke of cattle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That person said, &ldquo;Even if you can&rsquo;t give the full yoke
of cattle, I will give a half share of the value&rdquo;; thus he
promised.</p>
<p>The Vedar&#257;la having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and told
him to get and bring a torch, cunningly having gone near the yoke of
cattle that remained entangled in the bush at that place where he went
on coming, asked if these were his oxen. Then the man said,
&ldquo;These are indeed my cattle,&rdquo; and having unfastened them
and come back, in the morning gave him a half share<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e5329src" href="#xd26e5329" name="xd26e5329src">3</a> of the
value of the cattle. Taking it, and throwing away the chaff and coconut
husks, he went away.</p>
<p>That day also, having gone on until the time when it was becoming
night, he got a resting-place in the very way in which, having spoken
before, he got one. At the time when they were in the shed the persons
of the party said, &ldquo;Vedar&#257;la, what are you staying looking
about for? We must seek and get firewood and water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the house people say, &ldquo;What are you saying
&lsquo;Vedar&#257;la&rsquo; for? Does he know to say sooth and the
like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, this party say, &ldquo;He can also tell sooth. Last
night he sought and gave a yoke of cattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the house persons quickly having brought rice, fish, firewood,
water, gave them to the men.</p>
<p>This party having amply cooked and eaten, while they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>were
sleeping, the house person, having brought a packet of betel leaves,
spoke to the Vedar&#257;la: &ldquo;How am I to ask sooth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vedar&#257;la rebuked him. &ldquo;All these persons being now
without memory or understanding, what saying of sooth is
there?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5347src" href="#xd26e5347"
name="xd26e5347src">4</a> Then that one having gone, he went to
sleep.</p>
<p>A woman of the house was there; her name was Sihibudd&#299;. The
woman having heard the words which the Vedar&#257;la said, came and
having softly awakened the Vedar&#257;la, said, &ldquo;The
Sihibudd&#299; you mention is I indeed. It was I indeed who stole this
house person&rsquo;s packet of war&#257;gan.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5354src" href="#xd26e5354" name="xd26e5354src">5</a> I will give
you a share; don&rsquo;t mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Vedar&#257;la says, &ldquo;Where is it? Bring it
quickly, and having brought it place it near that clump of
plantains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this woman having brought the packet of war&#257;gan, and
placed it at the foot of the plantain clump and gone away, he went to
sleep.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Vedar&#257;la called the house person. &ldquo;Now
then, bring betel for me to say sooth.&rdquo; The man having brought
betel gave it to the Vedar&#257;la.</p>
<p>Then the Vedar&#257;la, having taken the betel and looked at it,
said, &ldquo;It is a packet of war&#257;gan that has been lost,
isn&rsquo;t it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That man said, &ldquo;It is that indeed. Should you seek and give
what has been lost of mine, I will give you a half share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Vedar&#257;la having told him to get a light, becoming
&ldquo;possessed,&rdquo; went and took and gave him the packet of
war&#257;gan that was at the foot of the plantain clump.</p>
<p>Having taken from it a half share, at the time when the party were
going on, thieves having broken into the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>box at the foot of
the King&rsquo;s bed,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5374src" href=
"#xd26e5374" name="xd26e5374src">6</a> he made public by beat of
tom-toms that many offices would be given by the King to a person who
should seek and give it to him.</p>
<p>At that time this party said, &ldquo;In our party indeed, there is a
sooth-sayer. On the night of the day before yesterday he sought out and
gave a yoke of cattle. Yesternight he sought out and gave a packet of
war&#257;gan.&rdquo; Thereupon the persons took this Vedar&#257;la near
the King. Then the King asks, &ldquo;Can he catch and give the thief
who broke into the box at the foot of my bed?&rdquo; The party said
that he could.</p>
<p>Then the sooth-sayer, having become afraid, thought, &ldquo;I will
tie a cord to my neck and die.&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;After tying
white cloths in a house (as a decoration, on the walls and under the
roof), and a piece of cord to the cross-beam, and placing a bed,
chairs, and table in it, and setting on end a rice mortar, you must
give me it in the evening.&rdquo; The King having prepared them in that
very way, gave him them.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Vedar&#257;la, after it became night, having gone
inside the house, told them to shut the door from the outside, and lock
it. Then having mounted on the rice mortar, when he tried to put the
cord round his neck it was too short. On account of it he said,

<p>As the Vedar&#257;la was saying this word Kumand&#257;&#275;yi, a
citizen, Kumand&#257;, an old thief, was there [listening outside].
Having heard this, he thought, &ldquo;He is calling out my name&rdquo;;
so becoming afraid he came near and spoke to the Vedar&#257;la, and
said, &ldquo;It is I indeed whom you call Kumand&#257;. It is I indeed
who committed the theft. Don&rsquo;t say anything about it to the
King.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Vedar&#257;la said, &ldquo;If so, bring the things and put
them in this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the old thief, having brought to the house all the things
taken out of the box which was at the foot of the King&rsquo;s bed,
gave them to the sooth-sayer through the window.</p>
<p>Then the Vedar&#257;la slept until light having come it became
daylight.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the King having sent messengers in the morning, they
awoke the Vedar&#257;la. Then the Vedar&#257;la, thinking it
unseasonable, said, &ldquo;Who is talking to me without allowing me to
sleep?&rdquo; and silently went to sleep again. So the messengers
returned and told the King.</p>
<p>Afterwards the King came and spoke to him, and opened the door. The
Vedar&#257;la having come out, said, &ldquo;O Lord, Your Majesty, I was
unable to seize the thieves; the things indeed I met with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;The thief does not matter; after you have
met with the things it is enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King, catching a great many fire-flies and putting them in
a coconut shell, asked the Vedar&#257;la, &ldquo;What is there in
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sooth-sayer, becoming afraid, went as far as he could see him,
and thinking, &ldquo;I will strike my head against a tree and
die,&rdquo; came running and struck his head against a tree.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5413src" href="#xd26e5413" name="xd26e5413src">8</a>
Then the sooth-sayer said, &ldquo;O Father! It was as though a hundred
fire-flies flew about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;That is true. They are indeed fire-flies that
are in my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King caught a bird, and clenching it in his fist,
asked the sooth-sayer, &ldquo;What is there in this fist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sooth-sayer, having become afraid, began to beat his head on a
stone. Then he said, &ldquo;Kurulu-gama Appu&rsquo;s strength went
(this time).&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5422src" href=

<p>The King said, &ldquo;Bola, it is indeed a bird that is in my
hand&rdquo;; and having called the Vedar&#257;la, and given him many
offices, and a house, told him to stay at that very city.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Vedar&#257;la, thinking, &ldquo;They will call me
again to tell sooth,&rdquo; having put away the things that were in the
house, and having set fire to the house, said, &ldquo;Kurulu-gama
Appu&rsquo;s sooth-saying is finished from to-day. The sooth books have
been burnt.&rdquo; Having made it public he stayed at that very
city.</p>

<p class="first">The second discovery of the sooth-sayer is extracted
from a variant by a washerman, the rest of the story having been
written by a man of the cultivating caste.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i>
(Tawney), vol. i, p. 272</span>, there is an account of a pretended
sooth-sayer, a poverty-stricken Br&#257;hma&#7751;a. He first hid a
horse, and when application was made to him to discover it, he drew
diagrams and described the place where it would be found. After that,
when a thief stole gold and jewels from the King&rsquo;s palace he was
sent for and shut up in a room, where he began to blame his tongue,
<i lang="si-latn">jivha</i>, which had made a vain pretence at
knowledge. The principal thief, a maid called Jivh&#257;, overheard
him, and told him where she had buried her share of the plunder.
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5449" title=

a frog in a covered pitcher. He expected that he would be killed, and
said, &ldquo;This is a fine pitcher for you, Frog (his father&rsquo;s

of yourself in this place.&rdquo; He was thought a great sage, and the
King presented him with &ldquo;villages with gold, umbrella, and
vehicles of all kinds.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="main">How a Prince was chased by a Yaksan&#299;, and what
befel</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A prince went for hunting-sport. As he was going, a
Yaksan&#299; (female Yak&#257;) who was living in the midst of the
forest, chased him, saying that she was going to eat the Prince, and
drove the Prince down the path. The Prince having gone running, went
bounding through the middle of a city. The Yaksan&#299; followed him in
the disguise of a woman.</p>
<p>The King of the city having seen them, sent the Ministers, and told
them to look what it was about. The Ministers asked the Yaksan&#299;
who was bounding behind him, &ldquo;What is that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;My husband having quarrelled with me
and left me, is running away. I am running after him because of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ministers then brought her before the King, and having seen the
beauty of the Yaksan&#299;, the King was pleased with her, and said,
&ldquo;If you should not go with him it does not matter; stay
here.&rdquo; So the King, having prepared another house for the
Yaksan&#299;, and having married her, establishing her in the office of
Chief Queen, she remained there.</p>
<p>While she was there, this Yaksan&#299; having gone like a thief
during the time when all were sleeping, and killed and eaten the men of
the city, brought a few of the bones, and placed them in a heap at the
back of the houses in which the twelve Queens of the King slept.</p>
<p>When a little time had gone by in this manner, the men <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>of
the city came to the King, and saying, &ldquo;Since you have brought
and are keeping this Yaksan&#299; this city is altogether
desolate,&rdquo; made obeisance. Then the King made inquiry into the
matter.</p>
<p>Then that Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;An&#275;! O Lord, Your Majesty,
I indeed do not know about that, but I did indeed see that thief who
eats human flesh, although I did not tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yaksan&#299; said, &ldquo;If Your Majesty should look behind the
houses of the twelve Queens you can ascertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the King went there and looked, he found that it was true, and
gave orders for the twelve Queens to be killed. Then the Yaksan&#299;
told him not to kill them, but to pluck out their eyes, and send them
into the midst of the forest. Having heard the words which the
Yaksan&#299; said, he acted in that very manner.</p>
<p>So all this party of Queens went and stayed in one spot, and there
all the twelve bore children. As each one was born, they divided and
ate it. The youngest Queen put aside all the flesh that was given to
her, and while she was keeping it she, also, bore a son. Then those
eleven Queens made ready to eat that Prince, so that Princess gave them
the flesh which she had kept, and the party ate it.</p>
<p>As time went on that Prince having grown a little, began to bring
and give them fruits that were lying on the ground. Then the Prince met
with a bow and an arrow that had been concealed there. After that he
began to shoot various kinds of small animals, and to bring and give
them to the Queens. Afterwards he shot large animals, and having
brought fire and boiled them, he gave the flesh to them. By this time
the Prince understood all things thoroughly.</p>
<p>After that, one day this Prince asked, &ldquo;Mother, what is the
reason why your eyes have become blind, and my eyes are
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party said, &ldquo;We were the Queens of such and such a King;
having taken a Yaksan&#299; in marriage, this was done to us through
her enmity.&rdquo; Then the Prince remained thinking of killing the
King. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day, as he was going hunting, he met with a Vaedd&#257;.
Thinking he would kill the Vaedd&#257;, the Prince chased him along the
path. The Vaedd&#257;, being afraid, went running away, and having met
with the King said, &ldquo;O Lord, Your Majesty, there is a very
handsome Prince in the midst of this forest. One cannot say if the
Prince is the son of a deity or a royal Prince. He does not come near
enough to speak. When he sees a man he drives him away, saying he is
going to eat him.&rdquo; He spoke very strongly about it.</p>
<p>So the Ministers were sent by the King, who told them to seize and
bring him. As the party were going to seize him, he sprang forward,
saying that he was going to eat them. At that, the party became afraid,
and ran away. Having come running, they told the King, &ldquo;O Lord,
Your Majesty, we cannot seize him. He comes springing at us saying he
is going to eat us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King came, bringing his war army. Thereupon the Prince, who
before that was angry with the King in his mind, threw a stone in order
to kill the King, and struck him. Being struck by the stone, the
King&rsquo;s head was wounded (<i>lit.</i> split), so the King and all
of them became afraid, and ran away.</p>
<p>The King, having returned, wrote letters to foreign countries:
&ldquo;There is a wicked Prince in the midst of the forest in my
kingdom. Who he is I cannot find out. Because of it you must come to
seize the Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince having got to know of it, and thinking, &ldquo;It is not
good for me to be killed at the hands of these men; having met with the
King I will kill him,&rdquo; went to the royal palace. When he arrived
there the King saw him, and asked, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I am a royal Prince; I stay in the midst of
this forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;Would it be a bad thing if you remained at
this palace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;What work would there be for me<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e5512" title="Source: .">?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;Remain and do the work of the First Minister
of the Ministers.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href=
"#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;How much pay would there be for me for the
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King replied, &ldquo;I will give fifty masuran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty masuran are insufficient for me. Will you give me every
day in the evening a hundred masuran?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and after that he stayed
there. While remaining there he came twice a day and assisted his
twelve mothers.</p>
<p>When no long time had gone by, some one was heard crying out in the
night near the city. The King told him to look who was crying. The
Prince having gone, taking his sword, when he looked, a dead body was
hanging in a tree, and a Yaksan&#299; was springing up to eat the dead
body. Being unable to seize it she was crying out.</p>
<p>The Prince went and asked, &ldquo;What is that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yaksan&#299; replied, &ldquo;My son having gone into the tree
cannot descend; because of it I am crying out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;Mount on my shoulders and unfasten
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Yaksan&#299; having got on his shoulders, as she was about to
eat the Prince he chopped at her with his sword. A foot was cut off,
and she fled. Taking the foot and returning with it, the Prince showed
it to the King. The King having seen the Prince&rsquo;s resoluteness,
in order to cause him to be killed said that unless he should bring the
other foot he could not take charge of this one.</p>
<p>After that, the Prince went to the palace where the Yak&#257;s
dwelt. There this Yaksan&#299; whom he had wounded came, and having
made obeisance, fell down and said, &ldquo;Lord, do not kill me. I will
do anything you tell me.&rdquo; Summoning her to accompany him and
returning, he showed her to the King.</p>
<p>Afterwards he employed this Yaksan&#299;, and caused her to make a
city at the place where his mothers were, and having made her construct
a palace, he told the Yaksan&#299; and his mothers to dwell there.</p>
<p>While they were there the Yaksan&#299; said to the Prince, &ldquo;I
know the place where the King&rsquo;s life is. Whatever <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>you
should do to the King himself you cannot kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in a golden parrot in such and such a tree,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>After that he went there and caught the parrot and killed it. Then
the King died.</p>
<p>After he died, the Prince having set fire to the palace there, and
cut down the Yaksan&#299; who stayed with the King, left his mothers in
charge of the city formed by the maimed Yaksan&#299;, and remained
ruling the kingdom.</p>

<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i>,
Panj&#257;b (Swynnerton), p. 355</span>, a Princess in man&rsquo;s
disguise, acting as the King&rsquo;s guard, found a gh&#363;l in the
form of a woman howling under a corpse that was hanging from a gallows.
She stated that it was her son whom she could not reach, and she asked
to be lifted up. When raised up to it by the Princess she began to suck
the blood, on seeing which the Princess made a cut at her, but only
severed a piece of her clothing, which proved to be of so rich a
quality that the King ordered her to procure more for his wife.</p>
<p>In the J&#257;taka story No. 96 (vol. i, p. 235) an Ogress in the
disguise of a woman followed a man into Takkasil&#257;, intending to

her. When he had given her authority over those who dwelt in the
palace, she brought other Ogres at night, and ate the King and every
one in the place. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a King and a Queen, it
is said. The Queen has no children. During the time while she was
rearing another (adopted) Prince, a child was born to the Queen.</p>
<p>After it was born, the King and Queen having spoken together,
&ldquo;Let us kill the Prince whom we have brought up,&rdquo; said to
the King&rsquo;s Minister, &ldquo;Take this Prince and put him down in
a clump of bamboos.&rdquo; The Minister having taken the Prince, and
put him down in a clump of bamboos, returned. The Prince was seven
years old.</p>
<p>After that, a man having gone to the bamboo clump to cut bamboos,
and having seen, when he looked, that this Prince was there, without
stopping to cut bamboos took away this Prince.</p>
<p>On the following day the King said to the Minister, &ldquo;Look if
the Prince is in the bamboo bush, and come back.&rdquo; Afterwards he
went, and when he looked, the Prince was not there. So he came to the
King, and said, &ldquo;The Prince is not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;The man who went away after cutting
bamboos will have taken him. Give these thousand masuran, and bring
him.&rdquo; Having said this, he gave him a thousand masuran. The
Minister, having taken the thousand masuran, and given them to the man
who took away the Prince, brought him and gave him to the King.</p>
<p>Afterwards the King said to the Minister, &ldquo;Take this one and
put him down in the middle of the path to a cattle fold in which five
hundred cattle are collected, and return, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>so that, having been
trampled on as the cattle are going along the path, he may die.&rdquo;
So the Minister having taken that Prince, and put him down in the
middle of the path to a cattle fold in which five hundred cattle were
collected, came away.</p>
<p>After that, as the five hundred cattle were setting off to go into
the cattle fold, when the great chief bull which went first was about
to go in, having seen this Prince he placed him under his body, and
allowing the other cattle to go in, this bull went afterwards.
Subsequently, as the herdsman who drove the cattle was going along he
saw this Prince, and taking the Prince the herdsman went away.</p>
<p>On the following day the King said to the Minister, &ldquo;Look if
the Prince is at the cattle fold, and come back.&rdquo; The Minister
went, and when he looked the Prince was not there. So the Minister came
and said to the King, &ldquo;He is not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King having given a thousand masuran into the
Minister&rsquo;s hand said, &ldquo;The herdsman who drove the cattle
will have taken him. Give these thousand masuran and bring him.&rdquo;
So the Minister having taken the thousand masuran, and given them to
the herdsman, brought the Prince and gave him to the King.</p>
<p>After that, the King said, &ldquo;Take this one and put him down in
the road on which five hundred carts are coming.&rdquo; So the Minister
having taken the Prince, and put him down in the road on which five
hundred carts were coming, returned.</p>
<p>Then the carters, having seen from afar that the Prince was there,
took the Prince, and placed him in a cart, and went home with him.</p>
<p>On the following day the King said to the Minister, &ldquo;Go and
look if the Prince is in the road on which the five hundred carts come,
and return.&rdquo; The Minister went, and when he looked the Prince was
not there. So the Minister came and told the King, &ldquo;The Prince is
not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King gave the Minister a thousand masuran, and said,
&ldquo;The carters will have taken him. Give these thousand masuran and
bring him.&rdquo; The Minister having <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>given the thousand
masuran to the carters, brought the Prince and gave him to the
King.</p>
<p>After that, the King said to the Minister, &ldquo;Speak to the
potter and come back. There is no other means of killing this one but
surrounding him with pottery in the pottery kiln, and burning
him.&rdquo; So the Minister went and spoke to the potter, &ldquo;Our
King tried thus and thus to kill this Prince; he could not. Because of
that, how if you should surround him even in the pottery
kiln?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The potter said, &ldquo;Should you bring him I will surround
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Minister came and said to the King, &ldquo;The potter told me
to take the Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the King wrote a letter: &ldquo;Immediately on seeing
the Prince who brings this letter, surround him in the pottery kiln,
and kill him.&rdquo; Having written that in the letter, and given the
letter to the Prince who had been adopted, he said, &ldquo;Take this
letter to such and such a potter, and having given it come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, as the Prince was going along taking the letter, the
King&rsquo;s Prince having played at &ldquo;Disks,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5616src" href="#xd26e5616" name="xd26e5616src">1</a>
and the counters having been driven out, was dragging along the hop
counters. Then, having seen this Prince, the King&rsquo;s Prince asked,
&ldquo;Where, elder brother, are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;Father gave me this letter, and told me to
give it to such and such a potter. Having given it I am going to
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King&rsquo;s Prince said, &ldquo;If so, elder brother, I will
give that letter and come back. You drag these hop counters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this Prince having said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and given the
letter into the hands of the King&rsquo;s Prince, dragged the hop
counters. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p>While the King&rsquo;s Prince was taking the letter, the potter was
making ready the pottery kiln. After the Prince had given the letter to
the potter, when the potter looked at it there was in the letter,
&ldquo;After you have seen this letter, surround in the pottery kiln
the Prince who brings this letter, and set fire to it.&rdquo; So the
potter taking the Prince surrounded him in the pottery kiln, and set
fire to it. While it was burning in the pottery kiln the King&rsquo;s
Prince died.</p>
<p>After the adopted Prince finished dragging the hop counters, and
came to the palace, the King asked, &ldquo;Did you give the letter to
the potter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;As I was going there, younger brother having
played at &lsquo;Disks,&rsquo; and the counters being driven out, was
dragging the hop counters. Having seen me going, younger brother asked,
&lsquo;Where, elder brother, are you going?&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;Father gave me this letter to give to such and such a potter;
having given it I am going to return.&rsquo; Then younger brother said,
&lsquo;Elder brother, I will give that letter and come; you draw these
hop counters.&rsquo; So I gave the letter into the hand of younger
brother, and I myself having drawn the hop counters came
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King quickly said to the Ministers, &ldquo;Go to the
potter, and look if the Prince is there, and return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ministers went and asked the potter, &ldquo;Is the Prince
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The potter said, &ldquo;I killed the Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Ministers came and told the King that the Prince was
dead.</p>
<p>The King immediately wrote a letter to the King of another city,
that when he saw the Prince who brought the letter he was to kill him;
and having given the letter into the hand of this adopted Prince, he
said, &ldquo;Give this letter to the King of such and such a city, and
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince having taken the letter went to the palace of the King of
the city. At that time the King was not in the palace; the King&rsquo;s
Princess was there. This Prince having grown up was beautiful to look
at; the Princess <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195"
name="pb195">195</a>]</span>thought of marrying him. Asking for the
letter in the hand of the Prince, when she looked at it there was
written that on seeing the Prince they were to kill him.</p>
<p>Then the Princess having torn up and thrown away the letter, wrote a
letter that on seeing the Prince they were to marry him to the
Princess. Having written it and given it into the hand of the Prince,
she said, &ldquo;After our father the King has come give him this
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, while the Prince, having taken the letter, was there,
the King came. The Prince gave him the letter. When the King looked at
the letter he learnt that on seeing the Prince he was to marry the
King&rsquo;s Princess to him. So the King married the King&rsquo;s
Princess to the Prince.</p>
<p>Having married her, while the Prince was there, illness seized the
King who brought up the Prince, and they sent letters for this Prince
to come. The Prince would not. Afterwards they sent a letter:
&ldquo;Even now the King cannot be trusted [to live]; he is going to
die even to-day. You must come.&rdquo; To that also the Prince replied,
&ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;Having said &lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; how
will it be? Let us two go to-day.&rdquo; So the Prince and Princess
came. When they arrived, the King was about to die, and breathing with
difficulty. The Prince came and sat near the King&rsquo;s feet; the
Princess sat near the King&rsquo;s head. The King told the Prince to
come near in order to give him an oath [to repeat], in such a manner
that he would be unable to seize any article of the King&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Well then, as the King was coming to mention the King&rsquo;s
treasure houses and all other things, while he was opening his mouth to
say the truth-oath to the Prince, the Princess, the King&rsquo;s
daughter-in-law, being aware of it, stroked the King&rsquo;s neck,
saying, &ldquo;If so, father, for whom are they if not for us?&rdquo;
Then that which the King was about to say he had no opportunity of
saying; while she was holding his neck he died.</p>
<p>After that, the Prince having obtained the sovereignty, and the
treasure houses, and the other different houses <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Speaking Horse</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a certain King who was greatly wanting
in common sense, and in his kingdom there was a
Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257; who was extremely wise. The King had a very
beautiful white horse of which he was very proud. The
Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257; was respected and revered by all, but for
the King little or no respect was felt, on account of his foolish
conduct. He observed this, and became jealous of the
Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257;&rsquo;s popularity, so he determined to
destroy him.</p>
<p>One day he sent for him. The Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257; came and
prostrated himself before the King, who said, &ldquo;I hear that you
are extremely learned and wise. I require you to teach my white horse
to speak. I will allow you one week to consider the matter, at the end
of which time you must give me a reply, and if you cannot do it your
head will be cut off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257; replied, &ldquo;It is good, O Great
King,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5755src" href="#xd26e5755"
name="xd26e5755src">1</a> and went home in very low spirits.</p>
<p>He lived with a beautiful daughter, a grown-up girl. When he
returned she observed that he was melancholy, and asked the reason, on
which the Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257; informed her of the King&rsquo;s
command, and said that it was impossible to teach a horse to speak, and
that he must place his affairs in order, in preparation for his
death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as I tell you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and your life will
be saved. When you go to the King on the appointed day, and he asks you
if you are able to teach his horse to speak, you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>must
answer, &lsquo;I can do it, but it is a work that will occupy a long
time. I shall require seven years&rsquo; time for it. You must also
allow me to keep the horse by me and ride it, while you will provide
food for it.&rsquo; The King will agree to this, and in the meantime
who knows what may happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257; accepted this wise advice. He
appeared before the King at the end of the week, and prostrated
himself. The King asked him, &ldquo;Are you able to teach my white
horse to speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mahar&#257;jani,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am able.&rdquo;
He then explained that it would be a very difficult work, and would
occupy a long time; and that he would require seven years for it, and
must have the horse by him all the time, and use it, while the King
would provide food for it.</p>
<p>The King was delighted at the idea of getting his horse taught to
speak, and at once agreed to these conditions. So the
Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257; took away the horse, and kept it at the
King&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>Before the seven years had elapsed the King had died, and the horse
remained with the Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257;.</p>

&ldquo;It would be given,&rdquo; the narrator said. &ldquo;No, he gave

<p class="storyLocation"><i>North-western Province.</i></p>
<p>In a variant which I heard in the Southern Province, a bird laid two
eggs in a crevice between two stones, which drew close together. She
went to a Mason or Stone-cutter; (2) to a Pig; (3) to a Hunter; (4) to
an Elephant, which she requested to kill him; (5) to a Lizard
(<i>Calotes</i>), which she told to crawl up the Elephant&rsquo;s trunk
into its brain; (6) to a Jungle Hen, which she told to peck and kill
the Lizard; (7) to a Jackal, who, when requested to kill the Jungle
Hen, at once agreed, and said, &ldquo;It is very good,&rdquo; and set
off after her.</p>

and Temple), p. 209</span>&mdash;<span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the
Punjab</i>, p. 195</span>&mdash;there is a variant. While a
farmer&rsquo;s wife was winnowing corn, a crow carried off a grain, and
perched on a tree to eat it. She threw a clod at it, and knocked it
down, but the grain of corn rolled into a crack in the tree, and the
crow, though threatened with death in case of failure, was unable to
recover it.</p>
<p>It went for assistance, and requested (1) a Woodman to cut the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>tree; (2) a King to kill the man; (3) a Queen to
coax the King; (4) a Snake to bite the Queen; (5) a Stick to beat the
Snake; (6) Fire to burn the Stick; (7) Water to quench the Fire; (8) an
Ox to drink the water; (9) a Rope to bind the Ox; (10) a Mouse to gnaw
the Rope; (11) a Cat to catch the Mouse. &ldquo;The moment the Cat
heard the name Mouse, she was after it, for the world would come to an
end before a Cat would leave a Mouse alone.&rdquo; In the end the Crow
got the grain of corn, and saved its life.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Folk Tales</i> (Gordon), p.
53</span>, there is an allied variant. A bird had bought three grains
of corn for three cowries, and while she was on a new cart eating them
one fell into a joint of the cart where she was unable to get it.</p>
<p>She appealed to (1) the Carpenter to take the cart to pieces, so
that she might obtain it; (2) the King to make him do it; (3) the Queen
to persuade the King; (4) a Deer to graze in the Queen&rsquo;s garden;
(5) the Stick to beat the Deer; (6) the Fire to burn the Stick; (7) the
Lake to quench the Fire; (8) the Rats to fill up the Lake; (9) the Cat
to attack the Rats; (10) the Elephant to crush the Cat; (11) an Ant to
crawl into the Elephant&rsquo;s ear; (12) the Crow, &ldquo;the most
greedy of all creatures,&rdquo; to eat the Ant. The Crow consented, and
the usual result followed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain city, while a female Pied Robin<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5917src" href="#xd26e5917" name="xd26e5917src">1</a>
was digging and digging on a dung-hill, she met with a piece of scraped
coconut refuse, it is said. She took it, and put it away, and having
gone again, while she was digging and digging there was a lump of rice
dust. Having taken it, and put it to soak, she said,
&ldquo;Sister-in-law at that house, Sister-in-law at this house, come
and pound a little flour.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5921src"
href="#xd26e5921" name="xd26e5921src">2</a></p>
<p>The women, saying, &ldquo;No, no, with such a fragment you can pound
that little bit yourself,&rdquo; did not come.</p>
<p>The Pied Robin pounded the flour, and cooking a cake of the size of
a rice mat (<i lang="si-latn">wa&#7789;&#7789;iya</i>), and tying a
hair-knot of the size of a box, and putting on a cloth of the breadth
of a thumb, while she was going away she met with a Jackal.</p>
<p>The Jackal asked, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having looked for a [suitable] marriage, I am going to get
married,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The Jackal said, &ldquo;Would it be bad if you went with
me?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5937src" href="#xd26e5937" name=
"xd26e5937src">3</a></p>
<p>The bird asked, &ldquo;What do you eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jackal said, &ldquo;I eat a land crab, and drink a little
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the bird said, &ldquo;Chi! Bullock, Chi!&rdquo; and while going
on again she met with a blind man.</p>
<p>The blind man asked, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Having looked for a [suitable] marriage, I am going to get
married,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The blind man said, &ldquo;Would it be bad if you went with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bird asked, &ldquo;What do you eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blind man said, &ldquo;Having chewed an eel, I drink a little
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the bird said, &ldquo;Chi! Bullock, Chi!&rdquo; and while going
on again she met with a Hunchback, chopping and chopping at a bank
(<i lang="si-latn">n&#299;ra</i>) in a rice field.</p>
<p>The Hunchback said, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having looked for a [suitable] marriage, I am going to get
married,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The Hunchback said, &ldquo;Would it be bad if you went with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bird asked, &ldquo;What do you eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hunchback said, &ldquo;I eat rice cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the bird having said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is good,&rdquo; the
Hunchback said, &ldquo;I put rice on the hearth to boil, and came away.
You go and look after it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the bird had gone to the Hunchback&rsquo;s house, she found
that the water was insufficient for cooking the rice, and except that
it was making a sound, &ldquo;Kuja tapa tapa, kuja tapa tapa,&rdquo; it
was not cooking.</p>
<p>So the bird went to the Hunchback, and said, &ldquo;The water is
insufficient for cooking the rice. It only says &lsquo;Kuja tapa tapa,
kuja tapa tapa.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5981src" href=
"#xd26e5981" name="xd26e5981src">4</a> Bring water, O
Hunchback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hunchback became angry [at the nicknames], and having come home,
when he was taking a water-pot to the well, a frog sitting on the well
mouth jumped into the well, making a sound, &ldquo;Kujija
b&#363;s.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5986src" href="#xd26e5986"
name="xd26e5986src">5</a></p>
<p>Then the Hunchback, having drawn and drawn up the water from the
well, caught and killed the frog, and tried to fill the water-pot with
water. The water continuing, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208"
href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>he poured it, to make a sound
&ldquo;Kuja ku&#7789;u ku&#7789;u, kuja ku&#7789;u
ku&#7789;u,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5996src" href=
"#xd26e5996" name="xd26e5996src">6</a> except that it splashed up does
not fill the water-pot.</p>
<p>Through anger at it, he took the water-pot and struck it against the
mouth of the well, and smashed it.</p>
<p>While he was coming home he met a Village Headman. The Village
Headman asked, &ldquo;Where, Mr. Hunchback, did you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hunchback said, &ldquo;What is the journey on which I am going
to thee, Bola, O Heretic?&rdquo; and having come home, killed the Pied
Robin, and ate the cakes that the bird brought.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Jackal and the Hare</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a Jackal and a Hare
living together, it is said.</p>
<p>One day when the Jackal was rubbing himself in the morning in the
open space at the front of the house, there was a pumpkin seed in his
hair. He took it and planted it. Afterwards, when the Hare went to the
open ground, and was rubbing himself, he also had a pumpkin seed in his
hair. He, too, took it and planted it. That which the Jackal planted,
being without water, died. The Hare having brought water in his ears,
and watered his seed, it sprouted, grew large, and bore a fruit.</p>
<p>After the fruit had become large, the Jackal and Hare spoke
together, &ldquo;Friend, with that pumpkin fruit let us eat pumpkin
milk-rice.&rdquo; They also said, &ldquo;Whence the rice, coconut, and
the like, for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Hare said, &ldquo;We two will go to the path to the shops.
You stay in the bushes. I will be lying down in the grass field
(<i lang="si-latn">pi&#7789;iya</i>) at the side of the path. Men going
along the road, having placed on the path the articles which they are
carrying to the shops, will come to take me. Then you take the goods,
and go off to the bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Jackal and Hare had gone to the path that led to the shops,
and seen a man coming, bringing a bag of rice, the Hare lay down in the
grass field as though dead. The Jackal hid himself and waited.</p>
<p>That man having come up, and seen that the Hare was dead, said,
&ldquo;App&#257;! Bola, there is meat for me.&rdquo; So he placed the
bag of rice on the road, and went to get the Hare. Then the Jackal came
running, and carried off the bag of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>rice into the bushes.
When the man was approaching the Hare, it got up and ran away. So the
man had neither the bag of rice nor the Hare. He went home empty-handed
(<i lang="si-latn">nikam</i>).</p>
<p>Again when the Jackal and Hare were looking out, they saw a man
come, bringing a pingo (carrying-stick) load of coconuts, and the Hare
went and lay down again in the grass field. The Jackal hid himself and
looked out.</p>
<p>Afterwards that man came up, and as he was going on from there he
saw that the Hare was lying dead, and saying, &ldquo;App&#257;! Bola,
there is a Hare,&rdquo; placed the pingo load of coconuts on the path,
and went to get the Hare. The Jackal, taking the pingo load of
coconuts, went into the bushes. As that man approached the Hare it got
up and ran away. So the man had neither the pingo load of coconuts nor
the Hare. He went home empty-handed.</p>
<p>As the Jackal and Hare were looking out again, they saw that a man
was bringing a bill-hook and a betel-cutter, which he had got made at
the forge. So the Hare went and lay down again in the field.</p>
<p>The man came up, and when going on from there, having seen that the
Hare was dead, placed the bill-hook and betel-cutter on the path, and
went to get the Hare. Then the Jackal carried the bill-hook and the
betel-cutter into the bushes. As that man was coming near to take the
Hare, it got up and ran away. So that man had neither the bill-hook,
nor the betel-cutter, nor the Hare. He went home empty-handed.</p>
<p>As the Jackal and Hare were looking out again, they saw a potter
coming, bringing a pingo load of pots, so the Hare went and lay down
again in the grass field. The Jackal hid himself and waited.</p>
<p>When the potter was going on from there, he saw that the Hare was
dead, and having placed the pingo load of pots on the path, he went to
get it. Then the Jackal, taking the pingo load of pots, went off into
the bushes. As the man was coming near the Hare it got up and ran away.
So that man had neither the pingo load of pots nor the Hare. He went
home empty-handed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211"
name="pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Jackal and Hare took home the bag of rice, and the pingo
load of coconuts, and the bill-hook, and the betel-cutter, and the
pingo load of pots. After that, having plucked and cut up the pumpkin
fruit, and washed the rice, and put it in the cooking pot, and placed
it on the fire, and broken the coconut, and scraped out the inside,
while squeezing it [in water in order to make coconut-milk], the Jackal
said to the Hare, &ldquo;Friend, I will pour this on the rice, and in
the meantime before I take it off the fire, you go, and plucking leaves
without a point bring them [to use] as plates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Hare was going for them, the Jackal ate all the rice, and
placed only a little burnt rice in the bottom of the cooking pot. Then
he lay down on the ash-heap.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Hare returned, and saying, &ldquo;Friend, there is
not a leaf without a point. I have walked and walked through the whole
of this jungle in search of one,&rdquo; gave into the paws of the
Jackal two leaves with the ends bitten off. Then, without getting up,
the Jackal said, &ldquo;And&#333;! Friend, what is the use of a leaf
without a point now? The rice people, the coconut people, the bill-hook
and betel-cutter people, the pots people having eaten the rice, and
beaten me also, rolled me over on this ash-heap. There will still be a
little burnt rice in the bottom of the cooking pot. Scrape it off, and
putting a little in your mouth, put a little in my mouth too.&rdquo; So
the Hare having scraped off the burnt rice, and eaten a little of it,
put a little in the Jackal&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal said, &ldquo;Friend, a tick is biting my nose; rid
me of it.&rdquo; When the Hare was coming near to rid him of it, the
Jackal vomited all over the Hare&rsquo;s body. Then the Hare bounded
off to the river, and jumped into it, and having become clean returned
to the place where the Jackal was.</p>
<p>The Jackal asked, &ldquo;How, Friend, did you become
clean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hare said, &ldquo;I went to a place where a washerman-uncle is
washing clothes, and got him to wash me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jackal asked, &ldquo;Where is he washing?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Hare said, &ldquo;Look there! He is washing at the
river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Jackal went to the river, and said to the
washerman-uncle, &ldquo;An&#275;! Washerman-uncle, wash me too, a
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the washerman-uncle, having taken hold of the Jackal&rsquo;s
tail, had struck a couple of blows with him on the stone, the Jackal
said, &ldquo;That will do, that will do, washerman-uncle, I shall have
become clean now.&rdquo; But the washerman-uncle, saying, &ldquo;Will
you eat my fowls again afterwards? Will you eat them?&rdquo; gave him
another stroke. Then the washerman-uncle, having washed the clothes,
went home.</p>
<p>From that time the Jackal and Hare became unfriendly, and the Jackal
said that whenever he saw Hares he would eat them.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Leopard and the Mouse-deer</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a jungle wilderness in the midst of the forest
there is a rock cave. In the cave a Leopard dwells. One day when the
Leopard had gone for food a lame female Mouse-deer (<i lang=
"si-latn">M&#299;minn&#299;</i>) crept into the cave, and gave birth to
two young ones.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Mouse-deer having seen that the Leopard, having got
wet at the time of a very great rainfall, was coming to the cave, began
to beat the young ones, so the young ones began to squall. Then the
Mouse-deer came out, saying, &ldquo;There is fresh Leopard&rsquo;s
flesh, there is dried Leopard&rsquo;s flesh; what else shall I give
you? Having eaten these, still you are crying in order to eat fresh
Leopard&rsquo;s flesh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Mouse-deer was saying it, the Leopard heard it, and thought,
&ldquo;They are going to eat me,&rdquo; and having become afraid,
sprang off and ran away, thinking, &ldquo;I will go to my Preceptor,
and tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gone to him, the Jackal said, &ldquo;What is it, Sir? You are
running as though afraid. Why?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The Leopard then replied, &ldquo;Preceptor, the danger that has
happened to me is thus: A Mouse-deer having crept into the cave that I
live in, and having borne young ones there, as I was returning came
shouting and springing to eat me. Through fear of it I came running
away,&rdquo; he said to the Jackal.</p>
<p>The Jackal then said, &ldquo;What of that! Don&rsquo;t be afraid. I
will come with you and go there. As soon as I go I will bite her and
cast her out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they went near the cave, the Leopard having lagged <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>a
very little behind, said, &ldquo;Friend, I cannot go, I cannot
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Jackal said, &ldquo;If you are afraid to that extent, be so
good as to go after tying a creeper to my neck, and tying the other end
to your waist, Sir,&rdquo; he said to the Leopard.</p>
<p>So bringing a creeper, and tying one end to the Jackal&rsquo;s neck,
and tying the other end to the Leopard&rsquo;s waist, they set off to
go to the cave.</p>
<p>As they were going there, the Mouse-deer, having seen that the
Jackal was bringing the Leopard, began to beat the young ones. When the
young ones were squalling, the Mouse-deer having come out, says,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry; the Jackal is bringing another Leopard for
you.&rdquo; Then she says to the Jackal, &ldquo;Jackal-artificer, after
I told you to bring seven yoke of Leopards, what has the
Jackal-artificer come for, tying a creeper to only this one lean
Leopard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After she had asked this, the Leopard thought, &ldquo;They have
joined with the Jackal, and are going to kill me,&rdquo; and began to
run off. Then the creeper having become tightened round the
Jackal&rsquo;s neck, the Leopard ran away, taking him along, causing
the Jackal-artificer to strike and strike against that tree, this tree,
that stone, this stone.</p>
<p>The Leopard having gone a great distance in the jungle, after he
looked [found that] the creeper had become thoroughly tightened on the
Jackal-artificer&rsquo;s neck. Having seen that he was grinning and
showing his teeth, the Leopard says, &ldquo;The laugh is at the
Jackal-artificer. I was frightened, and there is no blood on <i>my</i>
body,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>When he looked again, the Jackal was dead, grinning with his teeth
and mouth.</p>

<p class="first">This story is given in <span class="bibl"><i>The
Orientalist</i>, vol. iv, p. 79 (D. A. Jayawardana)</span>, but the
animals that went to the cave are wrongly termed tiger and fox, which
are not found in Ceylon.</p>
<p>It is also related in vol. iv, p. 121 (S. J. Goonetilleke), the
animals being a hind and a tiger.</p>
<p>In vol. i, p. 261, there is a Santal story (J. L. Phillips), in
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>a goat with a long beard, which had taken refuge
in a tiger&rsquo;s cave frightened it when asked, &ldquo;Who are you
with long beard and crooked horns in my house?&rdquo; by saying,
&ldquo;I am your father.&rdquo; A monkey returned with it, their tails
being tied together. When they came to the cave, the monkey asked the
same question, and received the same answer, which frightened both
animals so much that they fled, the monkey&rsquo;s tail being pulled
off. When the tiger stopped, and began to lick himself, he found the
monkey&rsquo;s tail so sweet that he went back and ate the monkey.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Panchatantra</i> (Dubois)</span>, a
bearded goat frightened a lion that he found in a cave in which he took
refuge, by saying, &ldquo;I am the Lord He-goat. I am a devotee of
&#346;iva, and I have promised to devour in his honour 101 tigers, 25
elephants, and 10 lions.&rdquo; He had eaten the rest, and was now in
search of the lions. A jackal persuaded the lion to return, but the
goat frightened them again.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Old Deccan Days</i> (Frere), p. 303</span>,
a pandit frightened a demon in this manner, by scolding a wrestler who
brought for dinner an apparent goat which the pandit recognised as a
demon.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Wide-Awake Stories</i> (Steel and Temple),
p. 132 ff.</span>&mdash;<span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Punjab</i>,
p. 123 ff.</span>&mdash;a farmer&rsquo;s wife frightened a tiger that
was going to eat a cow. A jackal persuaded it to return, their tails
being tied together. On the tiger&rsquo;s running off again, the jackal
was jolted to death.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. iv, p.
257</span>, there is a Santal story by Rev. E. T. Cole, of a tiger
which was frightened by two brothers. The three sat round a fire and
asked riddles. The tiger&rsquo;s was, &ldquo;One I will eat for
breakfast, and another like it for supper.&rdquo; The men expressed
their inability to guess the answer, and their riddle was, &ldquo;One
will twist the tail, the other will wring the ear.&rdquo; When the
tiger was escaping, they held the tail till it came off.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Tot&#257; Kah&#257;n&#299;</i> (Small), p.

like the mouse-deer when the tiger came up. When the tiger returned
with a monkey, the lynx frightened it like the mouse-deer, by telling
its young ones that a monkey friend had sworn to bring a tiger that
day. On hearing this, the tiger killed the monkey, and fled.

<h2 class="main">The Crocodile&rsquo;s Wedding</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there is a Crocodile in the
river, it is said. On the high ground on the other bank there was a
dead Elephant. A Jackal of the high ground on this side came to the
river bank, and on his saying &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; the Crocodile rose
to the surface.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal said, &ldquo;Now then, how are you getting on,
living in that [solitary] way? I could find a wife for you, but to
fetch you a mate I have no means of going over to the land on that
bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Crocodile said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, if you would become of
assistance to me in that way can&rsquo;t I put you on the other
bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jackal said, &ldquo;If so, Friend, put me on the ground on the
other side, so that I may go to-day and ask for a mate for you, and
come back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Crocodile, placing the Jackal on his back, swam across the
river, and after placing the Jackal on the other bank returned to the
water.</p>
<p>The Jackal went and ate the body of that dead Elephant. Having eaten
it during the whole of that day, he returned again to the river. Having
arrived there, when he said &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; the Crocodile rose to
the surface and asked the Jackal, &ldquo;Friend, did you ask for a mate
for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Jackal said, &ldquo;Friend, I did indeed ask for a mate; we
have not come to an agreement about it yet. To-morrow I must go again
to settle it. On that account put me on the ground on the other
side.&rdquo; So the Crocodile, placing the Jackal on his back, swam
across the river, and placed the Jackal on this bank.</p>
<p>Next day, as it became light, the Jackal went to the river,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>and as he was saying &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; the
Crocodile rose to the surface. The Jackal said, &ldquo;Friend, in order
that I may go and make a settlement of yesterday&rsquo;s affair and
return again, put me on the other bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Crocodile, placing the Jackal on his back crossed the
river, and having placed the Jackal on the other bank went again into
the water.</p>
<p>The Jackal having gone to the dead body of the Elephant, and eaten
it even until nightfall, came to the river after night had set in. As
he was saying &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; the Crocodile rose to the surface,
and asked, &ldquo;Friend, did you get it settled to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jackal said, &ldquo;Friend, I have indeed settled the matter.
They told me to come to-morrow in order to summon her to come. On that
account put me on the far bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Crocodile, placing the Jackal on his back, went
across the river, and having placed the Jackal on the ground on this
side returned to the water.</p>
<p>The Jackal next day also, as it became light, went to the river.
When he said &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; the Crocodile rose to the surface.
The Jackal said, &ldquo;Friend, if I must bring and give you your mate
to-day, put me on the other bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Crocodile, placing the Jackal on his back, went
across the river, and having placed the Jackal on the ground on the
other side, went into the water.</p>
<p>The Jackal went that day to the dead body of the Elephant, and
having eaten it until nightfall the Elephant&rsquo;s carcase became
finished. In the evening the Jackal came to the river, and when he was
saying &ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; the Crocodile rose to the surface, and
asked, &ldquo;Friend, where is the mate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Jackal said, &ldquo;And&#333;! Friend, they made a mistake
about it to-day; they told me to return to-morrow to invite her to
come. Because of that put me on the other bank again. Having come
to-morrow I will bring and give you the mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Crocodile, placing the Jackal on his back, swam
across the river, and having put down the Jackal on the ground on this
side, went into the water. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href=
"#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Jackal, sitting down on the high ground on this bank, said
to the Crocodile, &ldquo;Foolish Crocodiles! Is it true that a Jackal
King like me is going to ask for a wedding for thee, for a Crocodile
who is in the water like thee? I went to the land on that bank to eat
the carcase of an Elephant which died on that side. To-day the carcase
was finished. So now I shall not come again. Thou art a fool
indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, the Jackal came away.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s Cakes</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a village there are a Gamar&#257;la (a village
headman or elder) and a Gama-Mahag&#275; (his wife) and their four
sons, it is said.</p>
<p>One day while they were there the Gamar&#257;la said to his wife,
&ldquo;Bolan, it is in my mind to eat cakes. For the boys and for me
fry ample cakes, and give us them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la was looking out for them for many days; the
Gama-Mahag&#275; did not cook and give him the cakes.</p>
<p>Again one day the Gamar&#257;la thought of eating cakes. That day,
also, the Gamar&#257;la reminded her of the matter of the cakes. On the
following day the Gama-Mahag&#275; having fried five large cakes,
placed them in the corn store. The boys having gone to the chena and
come back, after they had asked, &ldquo;Is there nothing to eat?&rdquo;
the Gama-Mahag&#275; said to the boys, &ldquo;Look there! There are
cakes in the corn store. I put them there for father, too; eat ye
also,&rdquo; she said. The boys having gone to the corn store, all four
ate the cakes.</p>
<p>After they had eaten them, the Gamar&#257;la, having gone to the
watch-hut, came back. After he came the boys said, &ldquo;Father, we
ate cakes.&rdquo; When the Gamar&#257;la asked, &ldquo;Where are [some]
for me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother puts them in the corn store,&rdquo; they
said.</p>
<p>When the Gamar&#257;la went to the corn store for the cakes to eat,
there were no cakes. &ldquo;Where, Bolan, are the cakes?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Saying, &ldquo;Why are you asking for them at my hands? If there are
none the boys will have eaten them,&rdquo; the Gama-Mahag&#275; pushed
against the Gamar&#257;la. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href=
"#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;Now I shall not remind you
again. You do not make and give me the food I tell you about.&rdquo;
Having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and thinking, &ldquo;Having
pounded and taken about half a quart of rice, and given it at a place
outside, and got the cakes fried, I must eat them,&rdquo; pounding the
rice he took it away.</p>
<p>As he was going he saw a poor house. Having seen it the
Gamar&#257;la thought, &ldquo;Should I give it at this house, these
persons because they are poor will take the rice, and I shall not be
able to eat cakes properly.&rdquo; So having gone to a tiled house near
it, and given a little rice, he said, &ldquo;Make and give me five
cakes out of this, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people of the house replied, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and
taking a little of the rice fried some cakes. The woman who fried them
then looked into the account. &ldquo;For the trouble of pounding the
rice and grinding it into flour, I want ten cakes,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Also for the oil and coconuts I want ten cakes, and for going
for firewood, and for the trouble of frying the cakes, I want ten
cakes.&rdquo; So that on the whole account for cooking the cakes it was
made out that the Gamar&#257;la must give five cakes.</p>
<p>Next day the Gamar&#257;la, having eaten nothing at home, came to
eat the cakes. Having sat down, &ldquo;Where are the cakes?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Then the woman who fried the cakes said, &ldquo;Gamar&#257;la, from
the whole of the rice I fried twenty-five cakes. For pounding the rice
and grinding it into flour I took ten cakes. For the oil and coconuts I
took ten cakes. For going for firewood, and for the trouble of frying
the cakes ten more having gone, still the Gamar&#257;la must bring and
give me five cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la thought, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#257;! What a cake
eating is this that has happened to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After thinking thus, having gone outside and walked along, and come
to that poor house, he sat down. As he was thinking about it that poor
man asked, &ldquo;What is it, Gamar&#257;la, that you are thinking
about in that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;The manner in which they fried and
gave me cakes at that house,&rdquo; and he told him about it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the man of that poor house said to the Gamar&#257;la,
&ldquo;Since we are poor you did not give the rice to us. If he had
given it to us wouldn&rsquo;t the Gamar&#257;la have been well able to
eat cakes? The Gamar&#257;la having given us the rice would have had
cakes to eat, and still five cakes to give for that debt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For those cakes I will teach the Gamar&#257;la a
trick,&rdquo; that poor man said to the Gamar&#257;la. &ldquo;The
husband of the woman who fried the cakes has gone to his village. The
woman is now connected with another man. Every day the man having come
at night taps at the door when he comes. After she has asked from
inside the house, &lsquo;Who is it?&rsquo; he makes a grunt,
&lsquo;Hum.&rsquo; Then having opened the door he is given by her to
eat and drink. To-day she will give the cakes made for the
Gamar&#257;la.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the Gamar&#257;la has gone at night in that manner, and
tapped at the door, she will ask, &lsquo;Who is it?&rsquo; Then say,
&lsquo;Hum.&rsquo; Then she will open the door. Having gone into the
house without speaking, she will give to eat and drink. Having eaten
and drunk, and been there a little time, open the door and come
away.&rdquo; Thus the poor man taught his lesson to the
Gamar&#257;la.</p>
<p>In that manner, the Gamar&#257;la having gone after it became night,
tapped at the house door.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6321src" href=
"#xd26e6321" name="xd26e6321src">1</a> &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; he said. Then having opened the door and
taken the Gamar&#257;la into the house, she gave him cakes and
sweetmeats to eat.</p>
<p>As he was eating them, some one else having come taps at the door.
The Gamar&#257;la became afraid. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo;
she said, and sent the Gamar&#257;la to the corn loft [under the roof
of the house, at the level of the top of the side walls].</p>
<p>Having sent him there she asked, &ldquo;Who tapped at the
door?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; he said. Then she opened the door, and
after she had looked it was the Tambi-elder-brother,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6330src" href="#xd26e6330" name="xd26e6330src">2</a> who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>was trading in the village. She got him also
into the house, and gave him sweetmeats to eat.</p>
<p>When a little time had gone, again some one tapped at the door. Then
the Tambi-elder-brother, having become afraid, prepared to run off
without eating the sweetmeats. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; she
said, and she put the Tambi also in another part of the corn loft [and
he lay down].</p>
<p>Having come back, after she had opened the door and looked, it was
the man of the house who, having been to the village, had come back.
She gave him water to wash his face, hands, and feet. After he had
finished washing, she gave him cakes and the like to eat, and water to
drink. The man afterwards lay down to sleep.</p>
<p>When a little time had gone, the man who went first to the corn
loft, the Gamar&#257;la, asked for water, saying, &ldquo;Water,
water.&rdquo; Then the man of the house having opened his eyes, asked,
&ldquo;What is speaking in the corn loft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you went to the village, as you were away a long time, I
made an offering of a leaf-cup of water to the deity. Perhaps the deity
is asking for it now,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Then the man told her to put a coconut in the corn loft. So the
woman put a coconut in the corn loft.</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la, taking the coconut in his hand, sought for a
place on which to strike it [in order to break it, so that he might
drink the water in it]. As he was going feeling with his hand, the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s hand touched a lump like a stone in hardness, the
head of Tambi-elder-brother. After he touched it, the
Tambi-elder-brother [not knowing what it was] through fear trembled and
trembled, and did not speak. Then the Gamar&#257;la, taking the
coconut, struck it very hard on the head of the Tambi-elder-brother,
thinking it was a stone.</p>
<p>The man of the house thought [before this], &ldquo;The water in the
coconut is insufficient for the deity. He will be ascending [and
leaving us].&rdquo; After he had quickly opened the door, and gone out
to get more water to give him, the Tambi-elder-brother sprang from the
corn loft, breaking his head, and ran away.</p>
<p>Then the man who came out to get the water said, &ldquo;My
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>deity! Here is water, here is water,&rdquo;
holding the water kettle in his hand. While he was calling out to him,
the woman having opened her eyes said, &ldquo;What is it, Bolan?&rdquo;
As she was coming outside the man said, &ldquo;The deity jumped down
and ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that very time, breaking out from the corn loft, the
Gamar&#257;la also jumped down and ran off. Then the man of the house
asks the woman, &ldquo;Who is that running away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman says, &ldquo;Why, Bolan, don&rsquo;t you understand in
this way? Didn&rsquo;t the God Saman also run behind him?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="main">The Kinnar&#257; and the Parrots</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a large forest there is a great Banyan tree. In
that tree many Parrots roost. While they were doing so, one day, having
seen a Crow flying near, a Parrot spoke to the other Parrots, and said,
&ldquo;Bolawu,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6370src" href="#xd26e6370"
name="xd26e6370src">1</a> do not ye ever give a resting-place to this
flying animal,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>While they were there many days after he said it, one day, as a
great rain was falling at night, on that day the flying Crow, saying,
&ldquo;K&#257;, K&#257;,&rdquo; came and settled on the tree near those
Parrots.</p>
<p>That night one Parrot out of the flock of Parrots was unable to come
because of that day&rsquo;s rain. Having seen that this Crow was
roosting on the tree, all the Parrots, surrounding and pecking and
pecking the Crow, drove it out in the rain.</p>
<p>Again, saying, &ldquo;K&#257;, K&#257;,&rdquo; having returned it
roosts in the same tree. As the Parrots getting soaked and soaked were
driving off the Crow in this way, an old Parrot, sitting down, says,
&ldquo;What is it doing? Because it cannot go and come in this rain it
is trying<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6382src" href="#xd26e6382" name=
"xd26e6382src">2</a> to roost here. What [harm] will it do if it be
here this little time in our company?&rdquo; thus this old Parrot said.
So the other Parrots allowed it to be there, without driving away the
Crow.</p>
<p>While it was there, the Crow in the night left excreta, and in the
morning went away. At the place where the excreta fell a tree sprang up
[from a seed that was in them]; it became very large.</p>
<p>As it was thus, one day as Kinnar&#257;s were going near that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>[Crows&rsquo;] village, having seen that another
tree was near the tree in which the Parrots roosted, the Kinnar&#257;s
spoke with each other, &ldquo;In these days cannot we catch the Parrots
that are in this tree?&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>Before that, the Kinnar&#257;s were unable to catch the Parrots in
the tree. There was then only that tree in which the Parrots roosted.
When the <span class="corr" id="xd26e6395" title=
"Source: Kinnaras">Kinnar&#257;s</span> were going along the tree to
catch the Parrots, the Parrots got to know [owing to the shaking of the
tree], so all the Parrots flew away. Because of that they were unable
to catch the Parrots.</p>
<p>The Kinnar&#257;s having [now] gone along the tree which had grown
up through the Crow&rsquo;s dropping the seed under the tree, easily
placed the net [over the Parrots&rsquo; tree]. All the Parrots having
come in the evening had settled in the tree. Having settled down, and a
little time having gone, after they looked, all the Parrots being
folded in the net were enclosed. The Parrots tried to go; they could
not.</p>
<p>While they were under the net in that way, the Parrot Chief says to
the other Parrots, &ldquo;How has another tree grown up under this tree
that we live in?&rdquo; thus the Parrot Chief asked the other Parrots.
&ldquo;At a time when I was not here did ye give a resting-place to any
one else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Parrots say, &ldquo;One day when it was raining at night, a
Crow having come and stayed here, went away,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>Then the Parrot Chief says, &ldquo;I told you that very thing,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t give a resting-place to any one whatsoever.&rsquo;
Now we all have become appointed to death. To-morrow morning the
Kinnar&#257;s having come and broken our wings, seizing us all will go
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a little time had gone, the Parrot Chief [again] spoke to the
Parrots, and said, &ldquo;I will tell you a trick. Should you act in
that way the whole of us can escape,&rdquo; the Parrot Chief said.
&ldquo;When the Kinnar&#257;s come near the tree, all of you, tightly
shutting your eyes and mouths, be as though dead, without even flapping
your wings. Then the Kinnar&#257;s, thinking we are dead, having freed
us one by one from the net, when they are throwing us down on the
ground, and have taken and placed all there, fly away after
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>they have thrown down the last one on the
ground,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>While they were there, a Kinnar&#257;, tying a large bag at his
waist, having come to the bottom of the tree, says, &ldquo;Every day
[before], I couldn&rsquo;t [catch] ye. To-day ye are caught in my
net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having ascended the tree, as he was going [along it] the
Kinnar&#257; says, &ldquo;What is this, Bola? Are these dead without
any uncanny sound?&rdquo; Having climbed onto the tree, after he looked
[he saw that] a part having hung neck downwards, a part on the
branches, a part in the net, they were as though dead.</p>
<p>Then the Kinnar&#257; saying, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#257;! Tell ye the
Gods! Yesterday having climbed the tree I had no trouble in spreading
the net; to-day having come to the tree I have no trouble in releasing
the net. A&#7693;&#257;! May the Gods be witnesses of the event that
has occurred! What am I to do with these dead bodies!&rdquo; and
freeing and freeing each one from the net, threw it down on the
ground.</p>
<p>As he threw them to the ground he said &ldquo;One&rdquo; at the
first one that he threw to the ground, and having taken the account [of
them], after all had fallen, at the time when the Kinnar&#257;, freeing
the net, was coming descending from the tree, the whole flock of
Parrots went flying away.</p>
<p class="storyLocation"><i>Village Vaedd&#257; of Bintaenna.</i></p>
<p>A version of this story from the North-western Province, by a
Duray&#257;, though shorter, contains the same incidents, the tree,
however, being another Fig, the Aehaetu, <i lang="la">Ficus tsiela</i>.
It ends as follows&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he [the Kinnar&#257;] was throwing them down in this way,
having been counting and counting &lsquo;One,&rsquo; the Parrot which
he counted last having flapped its wings and screamed, [according to a
pre-arranged plan, to show] that the man was cheated and that it had
escaped, flew away. All the Parrots having gone, after they had looked
into the account of the whole flock [found that] they were all
correct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Parrots said, &lsquo;Let us not give a resting-place
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>to the Crow. At the places where he goes he is a
dangerous one. To us also, this danger came now [through him].
A&#7693;&#257;! Because we gave this one a resting-place. O Vishnu,
burst thou lightning on him who did this to us! A&#7693;&#257;! Where
shall we all go now?&rsquo; After flying and flying in the midst of the
forest, all went to each place where they had relatives.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a village there is a rich foolish man. One son was
born to the man. When they had been there in that way for a long time,
as the rich man&rsquo;s son was growing up, his father died. Then all
this wealth came into the hands of his son. The son was a fool just
like the father.</p>
<p>One day, having seen a wealthy man going in a carriage in which a
horse was yoked, that rich man&rsquo;s son thought he ought to go in
that way in a carriage in which a horse was yoked. This rich man having
gone home spoke to a servant, and said, &ldquo;I will give thee thy
expenses for going and coming. Go thou, and buy and bring me a
horse,&rdquo; he said. Having said it, he gave him a hundred masuran,
and having given them sent him away.</p>
<p>This servant having gone on and on, went to a great big country.
Having gone there, he made inquiry throughout the
country&mdash;&ldquo;Are there horses to sell in this
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a man of that country said, &ldquo;The Gamar&#257;la of this
country has many horses,&rdquo; he said. This servant who went to bring
horses having given a masurama to the man whom he had met, said,
&ldquo;Please show me the house of the Gamar&#257;la who has the
horses,&rdquo; he said. So the man, calling the servant, having gone to
the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house, sent him there.</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la asked these men, &ldquo;What have you come here
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant who went to get horses said, &ldquo;I have come to take
a horse for money,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For whom?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a rich man in a village,&rdquo; he said. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having given fifty masuran he got a horse. After he got it he again
gave a masurama to that man who went with him. Having given it, and the
two persons having gone a considerable distance,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6477src" href="#xd26e6477" name="xd26e6477src">1</a> this man
left both the horse and the man to go [alone], and went home.</p>
<p>When the servant had taken the horse, and gone a considerable
distance, after he looked [he found that] night was coming on. On
seeing it, taking the horse and saying, &ldquo;This night I cannot
go,&rdquo; having sought and sought for a resting-place, he met with a
place where there were chekkus (mills for expressing oil). There this
man found a resting-place; and having tied the horse to an oil-mill,
this servant went to a village, and ate and drank, and having returned
went to a shed at the side of the oil-mill, and lay down to sleep.
Having become much fatigued because he had brought this horse very far,
the servant went to sleep.</p>
<p>At dawn, the man who owned the oil-mill, having arisen and come near
the oil-mill, when he looked saw that a horse was tied near the
oil-mill. So this man thought, &ldquo;Last night the oil-mill gave
birth to a horse&rdquo;; and unloosing it from the place where it was
tied, the owner of the oil-mill, having taken the horse home, tied it
in the garden.</p>
<p>Then the servant having opened his eyes, after he looked, because
the horse was not near the oil-mill went seeking it. Having seen it
tied in a garden close to a house, he spoke to the [people in the]
house, &ldquo;Having tied this horse near the oil-mill, in the night I
went to sleep. This one breaking loose in the night came here.&rdquo;
Unfastening it, as he was making ready to go, the man who owned the
house came running, [and saying], &ldquo;Where did my oil-mill give
birth to this horse for thee last night?&rdquo; he brought the horse
back, and began to scold the servant. Then the servant thought,
&ldquo;Now I shall not be allowed to go and give this horse to the rich
man. Because of it, I must go for a lawsuit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was going seeking a trial he met with a place where lawsuits
were heard. The servant having gone [there] told the judge about the
business: &ldquo;When I was bringing yesterday the horse that I am
taking for a rich man, it became <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>night while I was on the
road. As there was no way to go or come, I tied and placed the horse at
this oil-mill, and went to sleep. Having arisen in the morning, after I
looked, because the horse that I brought was not there I went looking
and looking along its foot-prints. Having seen that it was tied in the
garden near the house of the oil-mill worker, thinking, &lsquo;This one
breaking loose has come here,&rsquo; I unfastened it. As I was making
ready to bring it away, having scolded me and said that the oil-mill
gave birth to the horse, he took it,&rdquo; he said to the judge; and
stopped.</p>
<p>Then the judge says, &ldquo;If the oil-mill gave birth to the horse,
the horse belongs to the man who owns the oil-mill,&rdquo; the judge
said.</p>
<p>The servant having become grieved says, &ldquo;What am I to do now?
Without the masuran which the rich man gave me, and without the horse
that I got after giving fifty masuran, having gone to the village what
shall I say to the rich man, so that I may escape?&rdquo; he said with
much grief.</p>
<p>Then a Jackal having come there along the same road, and having seen
it, asks the servant, &ldquo;Because of what matter are you going
sorrowing in this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant says to the Jackal, &ldquo;Jackal-artificer,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6501src" href="#xd26e6501" name="xd26e6501src">2</a>
is the trouble that happened to me right to thee, according to what was
said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were going along, the Jackal, having gone behind him, asks
again, &ldquo;Tell me a little about it, and let us go. More difficult
things than that have happened to us&mdash;folds [full] of scare-crows
tangled together. As we cleared up those with extreme <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e6508" title="Source: case">care</span> there is no
difficulty in clearing up this also.&rdquo; So the Jackal-artificer
said to the servant.</p>
<p>Then the servant told the Jackal the way in which the rich man gave
the servant one hundred masuran; the way in which, having given fifty
masuran, he got the horse; the way in which, having brought the horse,
he tied and placed it at the oil-mill; the way in which the oil-mill
owner, unfastening the horse, went and tied it; the way in which, after
he went to ask for it he would not give it, saying <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>that
the oil-mill gave birth to the horse, and came to scold him; then also
what the judge said. The servant told [these] to the Jackal-artificer,
making all clear.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal-artificer says, &ldquo;An&#275;! That&rsquo;s thick
work. I&rsquo;ll put that right for you. You must assist me
also,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You yourself having gone near the judge
again, and made obeisance, you must say, &lsquo;The oil-mill did not
give birth to the horse. The owner of the oil-mill, unfastening it from
the place where I tied it, took it away. I have evidence of it. Having
heard the evidence please do what you want,&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; so the
Jackal taught him.</p>
<p>So the servant having gone, made obeisance to the judge. &ldquo;What
have you come again for?&rdquo; the judge asked.</p>
<p>Then the servant says, &ldquo;The oil-mill did not give birth to the
horse. Unfastening it from the place where I tied it, and having gone,
he tied it up. I have evidence of it. Having heard the evidence do what
you want, Sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The judge says, &ldquo;It is good. Who is your witness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jackal-artificer,&rdquo; he said. So the judge sent a
message to the Jackal to come. That day the Jackal did not come. On the
following day, also, he sent a message. He did not come. Next day he
sent a message. That day the Jackal, having thoroughly prepared
himself, came to the judgment court.</p>
<p>After the judge asked, &ldquo;Dost thou know about this
lawsuit?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; the Jackal-artificer said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didst thou not come yesterday,&rdquo; the judge asked the
Jackal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday I did not come; I saw the sky,&rdquo; he said.
While saying it the Jackal was sleepy.</p>
<p>Again he asked, &ldquo;Why didst thou not come on the first
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that day I saw the earth,&rdquo; he said. While saying it
the Jackal was sleepy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why hast thou come to-day?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day I saw the fire,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having seen the sky why didst thou not come?&rdquo; the judge
asked.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal says, &ldquo;O Lord, the sky cannot be trusted.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>Sometimes it rains, sometimes it clears up.
Because of that I did not come.&rdquo; Having said it he was
sleepy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having seen the earth why didst thou not come?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That also cannot be trusted,&rdquo; he said<span class="corr"
id="xd26e6551" title="Source: ,">.</span> &ldquo;In some places there
are mounds, in some places it is flat; in some places there is water,
in some places there is not water,&rdquo; he said. Having said it he
was sleepy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hast thou come to-day for?&rdquo; the judge asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day I saw the fire,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because of that
I came,&rdquo; he said. Then the Jackal says, &ldquo;After the fire has
blazed up you do not look after your cold hut. I do not look after my
palace also.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6558src" href=
"#xd26e6558" name="xd26e6558src">3</a> Having said it the Jackal was
sleepy.</p>
<p>On account of that saying the judge having become angry,
&ldquo;Being here what art thou sleeping for?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&#275;! O Lord who will become a thousand Buddhas [in
future existences], I am very sleepy indeed,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Bola?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night I went to look at the fishes sporting on the land.
Because of that I am sleepy,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the judge having become angry with the Jackal, says very
severely, &ldquo;Having beaten him, cast ye him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This rascally Jackal having prayed with closed paws, saying,
&ldquo;O Lord, who will become a thousand Buddhas,&rdquo; fell down and
made obeisance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what country, Bola, Jackal, do the fish who are in the
water sport on the land?&rdquo; the judge asked the Jackal.</p>
<p>The Jackal said, &ldquo;I must receive permission [to ask also a
question], O Lord. How does an oil-mill which expresses the kinds of
oils give birth to horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the judge, having become ashamed and his anger having gone,
told the rich man&rsquo;s servant to take away the horse.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Fables</i>, p.
45</span>, Mr. P. V. Ramaswami Raju gives a South Indian variant of the
latter part of this story. A thief stole a horse that was tethered to a
tree, and then stated that he saw the tree eat the horse. The case was
referred to a fox [jackal]. The fox said he felt dull. &ldquo;All last
night the sea was on fire; I had to throw a great deal of hay into it
to quench the flames, so come to-morrow and I shall hear your
case.&rdquo; When he was asked how hay could quench flames, he replied,
&ldquo;How could a tree eat up a horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i>,
Panj&#257;b (Swynnerton), p. 142</span>, there is a story about a foal
that was born in the night while a mare was left near an oil-press, and
was claimed by the oil man. The King who tried the case decided that
the &ldquo;mare could not possibly have had this foal, because, you
see, it was found standing by the oil-press.&rdquo; A jackal assisted
the owner to recover it, and fell down several times in the court,
explaining that during the night the sea caught fire, and he was tired
out by throwing water on it with a sieve, to extinguish it. When asked
how this could be possible, the jackal retorted by inquiring if any one
in the world ever heard of an oil-press&rsquo;s bearing a foal.</p>
<p>In the interior of West Africa there is a variant, given in <i lang=
"fr">Contes Soudanais</i> (C. Monteil), p. 23. A mare was buried near a
house, and a pumpkin spread from the adjoining piece of land, until it
extended round the stake to which she was formerly tied. When the owner
of the pumpkin split open a fruit that grew near the stake, there were
two foals inside it, which the owner of the mare claimed. The judgment
was that as a dead mare could not bear foals nor a pumpkin contain
horses, neither of the claimants had a right to the foals; but as one
sowed the pumpkin, and the other had watered it, each should take one
foal.</p>
<p>In another tale in the same volume, p. 141, a hyaena had a bull and
a hare a cow, which bore a calf in the hare&rsquo;s absence. This was
claimed by the hyaena, as having been borne by the bull. The dispute
was referred to a male rat, which sent its young ones to say that it
could not leave its hole, as it was about to bear young ones. When the
hyaena laughed at the idea, and inquired when such an occurrence had
been known, the rat replied, &ldquo;Since it has been the bulls which
bore calves.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234"

<h2 class="main">The Jackal and the Turtle</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a village there is a large pond. At the margin of
the pond two Storks<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6615src" href=
"#xd26e6615" name="xd26e6615src">1</a> live. When they had been eating
the small fishes in that pond in that way for a long time, the pond
became dried up by a very great drought. These two Storks having eaten
the small fishes in the pond until they were becoming finished, one day
a Stork of these two Storks having spoken to the other Stork, says,
&ldquo;Friend, now then, that we have been here is no matter to us.
Because of it let us go to another district.&rdquo; Thus he spoke.</p>
<p>Now, a Turtle stayed in the pond. The Turtle having heard the speech
of these two Storks, the Turtle says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Friends, I also
now have been staying in this pond a long time. The pond having now
dried up, I also have nothing to eat, nor water to be in, and nowhere
to go. Because of it, friends, having taken me to the village to which
you two go, put me down there,&rdquo; the Turtle said to the two
Storks.</p>
<p>Then one Stork says to the Turtle, &ldquo;An&#275;! Bola, foolish
Turtles! How wilt thou go with us to another village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Turtle says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Friends, I indeed cannot go
flying to the village to which you go. You two somehow or other having
gone with me must put me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the two Storks say to the Turtle, &ldquo;If thou, shutting thy
mouth, wilt remain without speaking anything, we two having gone to the
place where there is water will put thee down there,&rdquo; the two
Storks said. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having said this they brought a stick, and said to the Turtle,
&ldquo;Grasp the middle of this stick tightly with the mouth, and hold
it tightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, the two Storks [holding the stick near the ends]
took the Turtle. While they were going flying, as they were going above
a dried field a Jackal saw the shadow going with the two Storks
carrying the Turtle. Having seen it the Jackal says, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
this a troublesome comrade they are taking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Turtle having become angry, says, &ldquo;The troublesome
comrade whom they are taking is for thy mother.&rdquo; So the
Turtle&rsquo;s mouth was opened. Then the Turtle fell on the ground.
The two Storks left him and went away.</p>
<p>The Jackal having come running, after he looked saw the Turtle, and
turning and turning it over to eat, when he tried to eat it the Turtle
says, &ldquo;I have now for a long time been staying dried up without
water. In that way you cannot eat me. Having gone with me to a place
where there is water and put me in it, should I become soaked you will
be able to eat me,&rdquo; he said to the Jackal.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal having taken hold of the Turtle with his mouth, and
placed it in a pond containing water, when he had been treading on it
[to prevent it from escaping] for a little time, the Turtle says,
&ldquo;Now every place is soaked. Under the sole of your foot, Sir, I
have not got wet. Should you raise the sole of your foot a little it
would be good,&rdquo; it said. So the Jackal raised the foot a little.
Then the Turtle crept to the bottom of the mud. The Jackal quickly
seized the Turtle [by its leg] again.</p>
<p>After he had caught it the Turtle says, &ldquo;The
Jackal-elder-brother being cheated has got hold of the Ke&#7789;ala
[plant] root.&rdquo; The Jackal-elder-brother quickly having let go the
Turtle, speedily got hold of the Ke&#7789;ala root that was near by.
Then the Jackal being unable [to go deeper], the Turtle going yet a
little further in the water, says, &ldquo;Bola! Even to-day you are
Jackals! When didst thou eat us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many Jackals prated to the Jackal about the Turtle. On account of
the Jackal&rsquo;s being unable to eat the Turtle <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>or
to seize it, he became much ashamed. While he was there, having
contrived and contrived a trick, saying he must somehow or other kill
the Turtle, another Jackal came there to drink water. Having drunk
water, he asks the other Jackal, &ldquo;What, friend, are you thinking
of and clenching your nails about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Jackal who was unable to seize the Turtle, says,
&ldquo;Friend, a Turtle cheated me, and went into this pond. Having
become angry on account of that, I am looking for it in order to kill
that one should that one come onto the land,&rdquo; he said to the
other Jackal.</p>
<p>That Jackal says, &ldquo;&#256;&#275;, Bola! Fool! How many Turtles
are there yet in the pond? How canst thou seek out the one that cheated
thee?&rdquo; the Jackal that came to drink water said.</p>
<p>Every day in that manner this Jackal comes to the pond to drink
water. One day when he came to drink water, having seen that a crowd of
Turtles are grimacing on the lotus, the Jackal says, &ldquo;If ye and
we be friends, how much advantage we can gain by it!&rdquo; Having
spoken thus on that day the Jackal went away.</p>
<p>Having gone, when he met the Jackal whom the Turtle cheated he said,
&ldquo;Friend, having met with a crowd of Turtles while they were in
the pond to-day, I spoke words [to them]. We must devise together a
trick to kill them.&rdquo; Having said this the two Jackals talked
together.</p>
<p>Again, on a day when the Jackal went to the pond to drink water,
having seen in the [same] way as on that day the Turtles grimacing on
the lotus, the Jackal says, &ldquo;How can ye and we remain in this
manner? Should ye and we, both parties, take wives [from each other]
wouldn&rsquo;t it be good?&rdquo; the Jackal asked the Turtles.</p>
<p>Then the Turtles say, &ldquo;If so, indeed how good it would
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one day we will come and speak with ye [about] the
wedding.&rdquo; Having said this the Jackal went away.</p>
<p>Having gone he says to the Jackals, &ldquo;[After] speaking words
with the Turtles who are in that pond regarding taking and giving wives
I have come away.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the other Jackals said, &ldquo;It is very good. Some day let us
all go.&rdquo; So they spoke.</p>
<p>Again on a day, after the Jackal had gone to the pond to drink
water, on that day, having seen that Turtles more than on the other day
were [there], he says, &ldquo;Friends, to-day about all of you are
[here]. Because of it, on what day will it be good to come and summon
[our wives]?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will say in a day or two days,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>The Jackal having drunk water and having gone, said to the other
Jackals, &ldquo;They said they will say in a day or two days [on which
day we are to go to summon our wives].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Jackal whom the Turtle cheated said, &ldquo;In some way or
other we must completely destroy them. Friends, somehow or other having
gone and spoken about this wedding, make ready quickly,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>On the following day this Jackal went to drink water, and to speak
about the wedding. Having drunk water the Jackal asked the Turtles,
&ldquo;When will it be good to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow will be good,&rdquo; the Turtles said.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal says, &ldquo;We shall all come. All ye also having
got ready be present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, the Jackal quickly came running, and after all the
Jackals had collected together, said, &ldquo;Let nobody of ye go
anywhere to-morrow. We must all go to call the Turtles for the wedding,
and return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jackal whom the Turtle cheated said, &ldquo;Somehow or other
having sought out the Turtle that cheated me and called it to the
wedding, I must torture it and kill it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, all the Jackals having collected together, started to go
to call the Turtles for the wedding. Having set off, the Jackal who
drank water at the pond having gone in front to invite the Turtles [to
be ready], said, &ldquo;They are coming to summon you to the wedding.
All ye having prepared for it be pleased to be quite ready,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Then all the Turtles having come and climbed onto the branches of
trees fallen in the pond, were looking out. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Jackal who came with the message having gone back near the
Jackals, said, &ldquo;All the Turtles having climbed on the trees and
the branches, are present looking out till we come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well then, all the Jackals having started, while they were going
with the tom-tom beaters, the Jackal who drank water at the pond said,
&ldquo;You stay here. I will go and look if the Turtles are coming or
what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gone, after he looked [he saw that] all the Turtles in the
trees, more than the Jackals, all having climbed onto the branches,
were looking out. Having seen [this] the Jackal says,
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you tom-toms, drums, kettle-drums?&rdquo; the
Jackal asked the Turtles. &ldquo;There! we indeed are coming beating
well the tom-toms, kettle-drums, drums, and [blowing] trumpets,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Then the Turtle Chief said, &ldquo;Beat our tom-toms,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Then all the Turtles began to beat tom-toms by singing, &ldquo;Gaja,
Gaja; Gora, Gora; Baka, Baka,&rdquo; enough to destroy the ears.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal having come running to the front of the Jackals,
said, &ldquo;All the Turtles having climbed completely along the
branches of the trees are there. We all having gone near the Turtles
must go along the trees that we can mount onto, and seize the
Turtles,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal Chief said, &ldquo;Not so. As we come very near the
Turtles beat this tom-tom verse,&rdquo; he said. Then all at a leap
having jumped onto the trees where the Turtles are he told them to
seize them. The very tom-tom verse that he told the tom-tom beaters to
beat on the tom-toms is, &ldquo;Ehe; Ka&#7789;a, ka&#7789;a,
ka&#7789;a. Ehe; Ka&#7789;a, ka&#7789;a, ka&#7789;a.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then when they were far off, the Turtles having seen the Jackals
coming, said, &ldquo;There they are, Bola. Now then, get
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were coming near, beating the tom-toms, &ldquo;Ehe;
Ka&#7789;a, ka&#7789;a, ka&#7789;a. Ehe; Ka&#7789;a, ka&#7789;a,
ka&#7789;a,&rdquo; the Turtles having heard all this, all the Turtles
began to cry out, &ldquo;Baka, Baka,&rdquo; as they came near.</p>
<p>Then, as they came very near, singing &ldquo;Baka, Baka,&rdquo; all
the Turtles sprang into the pond [and disappeared]. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span></p>
<p>On account of this thing that they did, the Jackals became still
more ashamed. &ldquo;These Cattle-Turtles have cheated us,&rdquo; they
said; and having become angry, went away.</p>
<p>The way the Jackal-artificers called the Turtles to the wedding is
good.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first part of this tale is found in the
J&#257;taka story No. 215 (vol. ii, p. 123). In it two Hansas or sacred
Geese asked a Turtle to accompany them to their home, a golden cave in
the Him&#257;layas. They carried it like the Storks. The Jackal is not
introduced at all. Some village children saw the Turtle in the air, and
made a simple remark to that effect. The Turtle, wishing to reply,
opened its mouth, and was smashed by falling in the King&rsquo;s
court-yard.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Panchatantra</i> (Dubois)</span>, as
well as in a variant of the North-western Province of Ceylon, and
elsewhere in the island, the story does not end at this point, but with
the escape of the Turtle after the Jackal had soaked it in the
water.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i>
(Tawney), vol. ii, p. 37</span>, the story ends with the fall of the
Turtle, which was being carried to a lake in which there was water. In
this case, as in the J&#257;taka story, the point to be illustrated
only required the Turtle to fall and be killed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The variant of the North-western Province is
practically identical with the first part of the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e6743" title="Source: Vaedda">Vaedd&#257;</span> tale, but the
drought is stated to have lasted for seven years. The Jackal was about
to howl, and on turning his head upward for the purpose saw two Black
Storks carrying the Turtle.</p>
<p>He asked, &ldquo;Where are you taking a present?&rdquo; (referring
to the way in which a considerable load is sometimes carried slung on a
stick, the ends of which rest upon the shoulders of two men, one in
front and the other behind). The Turtle replied, &ldquo;For your
mother&rsquo;s head.&rdquo; When the Jackal tried to eat it he heard
the Turtle laughing inside the shell, and said, &ldquo;Friend, what are
you laughing at?&rdquo; The Turtle said, &ldquo;I am laughing at your
thinking you can eat me in that way. I have been dried up for seven
years, and if you want to eat me you must first soak me in
water.&rdquo; The Jackal did this, and the Turtle escaped in the way
related by the Vaedd&#257;s.</p>

<div class="div2 section storyNotes"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The rest of the story is, I think, found only among
the Vaedd&#257;s. Although it is clear that it must have been invented
by the settled inhabitants of villages, the marriage custom according
to which the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>bride was to be taken to the bridegroom&rsquo;s
house to be married is not that of the modern Sinhalese, but is in
accordance with the story related in the Mah&#257;vansa, i, p. 33,
regarding the marriage of a Vaedi Princess at the time of
Wijaya&rsquo;s landing in Ceylon. The Sinhalese custom is found in the
story of the Glass Princess (No. 4), in which six Princes accompanied
by their parents, went to their brides&rsquo; city to be married,
returning home with their brides afterwards.</p>
<p>It is probable that the original story ended with the escape of the
Turtle from the Jackal after it was placed in the water. It is a
folk-tale, and not a story written to illustrate a maxim. It appears to
have been invented to show the folk-lore superiority of the
Turtle&rsquo;s intelligence over that of the Jackal. The Turtle is
always represented as a very clever animal, not only because of the
ease with which he can protect himself by withdrawing his head and legs
inside the shell&mdash;of which Mr. A. Clark, formerly of the Forest
Department of Ceylon, and I once had an amusing illustration at a pool
in the Kanakarayan-&#257;&#7771;u, when his bull-terrier made frantic
attempts to kill one, like the Jackal&mdash;but possibly also because,
as I was told of another amphibious animal in West Africa, &ldquo;he
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6755" title="Source: live">lives</span>
both in the water and on the land, therefore he knows the things of
both the land and the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. i, p. 134</span>,
the story as far as the escape of the Turtle was given by Mr. H. A.
Pieris, the animals concerned being wrongly termed Tortoise, Cranes,
and Fox; the two latter animals are not found in Ceylon. To this the
Editor added the story found in the <span class="bibl"><i><span class=
"corr" id="xd26e6767" title=
"Source: Hitopadesa">Hit&#333;padesa</span></i></span>, in which the
animals were a Turtle and two Geese, which agreed to carry the Turtle
to another lake in order that it might not be killed by some fishermen
next day. Some herdsmen&rsquo;s boys saw it, and remarked that if it
fell they would cook and eat it. The Turtle replied, &ldquo;You shall
eat ashes,&rdquo; fell down, and was killed by the men.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i>
(Tawney), vol. ii, p. 37</span>, the birds were &ldquo;Swans&rdquo;
(probably Hansas, which are always represented as geese in ancient
carvings in Ceylon). Some men made remarks to each other on the strange
object that was being carried, and the Turtle, on asking the birds what
the chattering was about, fell and was killed by the men.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Old Deccan Days</i> (Frere), p. 310</span>,
a Jackal escaped from an Alligator [Crocodile] in the same manner as
the Turtle.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Wide-Awake Stories</i> (Steel and Temple),
p. 155</span>&mdash;<span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Punjab</i>, p.
147</span>&mdash;an Iguana or Monitor Lizard outwitted a Jackal who had
caught him by the tail as he was entering the hole in which he lived.
Both pulled for a long time without any result. At last the Lizard said
he gave in, and requested the Jackal to allow him to turn round and
come out. When released he disappeared into the hole. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Lion and the Turtle</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a jungle there is a Lion King. While he was there,
one day there was no prey for the Lion King when he was walking about
seeking it. He obtained nothing as prey that day. As the Lion through
fatigue was staying below a great big tree, avoiding the heat, he went
to sleep.</p>
<p>While he was sleeping, a Turtle came out [of the bushes], having set
off to go away from there. As he was going along, a &ldquo;sara,
sara&rdquo; sound was heard, having been made by the dry leaves. The
Lion King having opened his eyes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6806src"
href="#xd26e6806" name="xd26e6806src">1</a> at the sound of this
Turtle&rsquo;s going, after he had looked saw the Turtle, and having
become angry sprang at once near the Turtle. Having said, &ldquo;Bola!
What art thou going on a rapid journey in this manner for? Didst thou
not see that I am [here]?&rdquo; the Lion King pushed against the
Turtle.</p>
<p>Then the Turtle says, &ldquo;O Lord who will become a thousand
Buddhas [in future existences], I didn&rsquo;t come to cause you alarm,
Sir; I am walking to procure my food,&rdquo; the Turtle said to the
Lion King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What art thou going to seek and eat in this forest?&rdquo;
the Lion asked.</p>
<p>Then the Turtle says, &ldquo;O Lord, I am walking to obtain and eat
any sort of things that I can eat,&rdquo; the Turtle said.</p>
<p>Then anger having gone to the Lion, he sprang to eat the Turtle.
Then the Turtle, having brought his head inside, became like a stone.
After he became thus, the Lion turning the Turtle to that side and to
this side, and having clawed him and bitten him, looked at him, having
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>been unable to do anything to him. After he had
been looking the Lion says, &ldquo;Having been like a what-is-it stone,
didn&rsquo;t you preach to me in overbearing words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had been looking at him a little time, as the Turtle, having
put his head outside again, was going off, the Lion says, &ldquo;Bola,
art thou a being who can do anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lord, the things that you, Sir, can do you do. I do the
things that I can do,&rdquo; the Turtle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bola, canst thou, who endest by drawing slowly and slowly
what is like a lump of stone, run, jump, roar, swim in rivers that way
and this way, equal to me? And what canst thou do to me, who having
roared and caused the bottom of the ears to burst, and killed every
animal, eats it?&rdquo; the Lion said.</p>
<p>Then the Turtle says, &ldquo;You, Sir, frighten and eat even all.
You cannot frighten and kill, nor eat, me except on land. In the water,
you, Sir, cannot swim that side and this side equal to me,&rdquo; the
Turtle said to the Lion.</p>
<p>After the Lion, having become angry, said, &ldquo;Wilt thou come to
swim that side and this side with me? If not, I will put thee under a
large stone,&rdquo; the Turtle having become afraid that he would kill
him, having given his word to swim with the Lion that side and this
side in a river, went near the river.</p>
<p>Having gone [there] the Turtle met with yet a Turtle, and said,
&ldquo;Friend, a great trouble has befallen me to-day.&rdquo; After the
friendly Turtle asked, &ldquo;What is it, friend?&rdquo; the other
Turtle says, &ldquo;The Lion King has come and wagered with me to swim
that side and this side,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the Turtle says, &ldquo;Why are you afraid of that, friend?
Say, &lsquo;It is good.&rsquo; I will tell you a good trick; you act in
that way. What is it? You place a red flower in your mouth. I will
place a red flower in my mouth. You having been on this side with the
Lion King, and having sprung into the river and hidden at the bottom of
the water very near there, remain [there]. I having hidden near the
river bank on that side will be [there]. The Lion King having come
swimming, as he is going to land on that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb243" href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>side, I being near
the river bank and having said, &lsquo;K&#363;rmarsha,&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6837src" href="#xd26e6837" name="xd26e6837src">2</a>
taking the flower will land [before him]. You also in that way having
been hidden near the bank on this side, as the Lion King is going to
land, having said, &lsquo;K&#363;rmarsha,&rsquo; quickly land [before
him].&rdquo; The friendly Turtle having said [this], hid at the bottom
of the water near the bank on that side of the river.</p>
<p>The Turtle that spoke with the Lion went near the Lion. Then the
Lion asks, &ldquo;Art thou coming to swim?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Your Majesty,&rdquo; the Turtle said.</p>
<p>Then [after they had gone to the river] the Lion said to the Turtle,
&ldquo;Thou, having swum in front, be off. I having come slowly shall
get in front of thee,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the Turtle, also holding a red flower in his mouth, having
descended to the river, and having gone a little far, got hid at the
bottom of the water. While it was hidden, as the Lion was going
swimming near the river bank, the other Turtle which stopped at that
side, having got in front before the Lion landed, and said,
&ldquo;K&#363;rmarsha,&rdquo; having placed a red flower also in his
mouth, landed on the river bank at once.</p>
<p>The Lion having seen him, again sprang into the river. As he came to
this side, the Turtle that remained at the bank at this side, having
got in front of the Lion at once, taking the flower also, said,
&ldquo;K&#363;rmarsha,&rdquo; and landed.</p>
<p>Again the Lion swam to the other side. In that very way the Turtle
having been there and said, &ldquo;K&#363;rmarsha,&rdquo; landed [in
front of him].</p>
<p>Thus, in that way, when swimming seven or eight times, the Lion, who
was without even any prey that day, having become unable to swim, and
being without strength in the middle of the river, died.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=

<p>In a variant of the North-western Province, the Lion lived in a
cave, and met the Turtle when he went to the river to drink. He told
the Turtle that it was unable to travel quickly because it always lived
in one place. The Turtle shrugged its shoulders, and replied,
&ldquo;Can you travel better than I?&rdquo; The Lion challenged it to
race with him, and the Turtle accepted the challenge, fixing the time
eight days later.</p>
<p>The race of the two animals was not across the river, but along it,
a series of Turtles having been stationed at various points where it
was arranged that the Lion should come to the bank and call out,
&ldquo;Friend.&rdquo; At each place a Turtle rose on hearing this, and
said, &ldquo;What is it, friend?&rdquo; At the fifth stage, the Lion
leapt over two stages as quickly as one, and broke his neck.</p>
<div class="div2 section storyNotes"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The resemblance of the race in this variant to that
between Brer Rabbit and Brer Tarrypin in <span class="bibl"><i>Uncle

five in both stories.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. i, pp. 87,
88</span>, Mr. W. Goonetilleke gave a variant from Siam, by Herr A.
Bastian, in which the animals were the Garu&#7693;a [or Rukh] and the
Turtle; and two others by Lord Stanmore, from Fiji, where the animals
were a Crane and a Crab in one instance, and a Crane and a Butterfly in
the other, the insect being perched on the bird&rsquo;s back during the
race. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=

<h2 class="main">The Monkey and the Weaver-bird</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the midst of a forest there were a Wandur&#257; (a
large grey Monkey, <i lang="la">Semnopithecus</i>) and a
Weaver-bird.</p>
<p>One day the Monkey came to the tree in which the Weaver-bird lodged,
and after that a great rain-storm began. The Weaver-bird without
getting wet remained in much comfort in its nest; the Monkey stayed in
a fork of the tree, getting thoroughly soaked.</p>
<p>Then the Weaver-bird said, &ldquo;Why does a person endowed with
hands and feet, and strength, like thee, get soaked in this rain? Such
a small animal as I am having built a house stays in it without getting
wet. Not a drop of rain leaks into it. If I were equal to thee I should
build a good house<span class="corr" id="xd26e6920" title=
"Source: ,">.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>On account of that remark the Monkey became angry, and saying,
&ldquo;What is my business to thee?&rdquo; broke down the nest of the
Weaver-bird.</p>
<p>Then the Weaver-bird went to the [Monkey] King, and instituted an
action [against the Monkey]. Afterwards, orders were issued by the King
to seize the Monkey. After remaining in concealment, the Monkey,
thinking, &ldquo;If I should be caught they will kill me,&rdquo;
plucked a Jak fruit, and went with it to the King. After that [the
King] caused the Weaver-bird to be brought, so that he might try the
case.</p>
<p>As he was inquiring into the case, it came to be accepted that on
account of his breaking down the nest the fault lay with the Monkey.
Then the Monkey said, &ldquo;The action is coming to an end. Will the
Maharaja be pleased to look behind me?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span></p>
<p>At that very time, when the King having considered [his judgment],
looked around, he saw that there was a Jak fruit behind the Monkey.
Then the King, thinking, &ldquo;The Jak fruit has been brought to be
given to me for the sake of obtaining my favour,&rdquo; said to the
Weaver-bird, &ldquo;The fault is in thy hands. Whether he gets soaked
or however he may be, it is no affair of thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, the King drove her away; and the Monkey, having
given him the Jak fruit, went away.</p>
<p>At that time animals were able to talk.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Jackal D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257;</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there was a dead Elephant, it is
said. A Jackal having gone to eat the Elephant&rsquo;s carcase, and
having eaten and eaten a hole into the Elephant from behind, passed
inside it. While he was eating and eating the carcase of the Elephant
as he remained inside it, the skin [dried and] became twisted up, and
the path by which the Jackal entered became closed.</p>
<p>A man who was a tom-tom beater was going near it, taking a tom-tom
for a devil-dance. Then among the bones the sound of tom-tom beating
was heard. So the Jackal asked, &ldquo;Who is going here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tom-tom beater said, &ldquo;I am going to this
devil-dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jackal said, &ldquo;What art thou going this way for, without
permission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tom-tom beater replied, &ldquo;O Lord, I am going without
knowing about this [permission&rsquo;s being necessary].&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jackal asked, &ldquo;What wilt thou obtain for the
dancing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tom-tom beater said, &ldquo;I receive presents and the
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Jackal said, &ldquo;I will give thee a present better than
money. It is owing to thy good luck that thou hast come this way. I am
a D&#275;vat&#257;w&#257; (deity) who is guarding his own treasure
here. If I am to give thee the treasure, split one eye (end) of the
tom-tom which is in thy hand, and having filled it with water and
brought it here, pour it on this Elephant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the tom-tom beater having plucked out the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>eye
of the tom-tom, filling it with water brought it, and poured it on the
Elephant&rsquo;s dried up carcase. The Jackal, also, sitting inside it,
worked and worked it into the skin with its muzzle. Having made the
skin pliable it sprang out, and went away.</p>
<p>When this man looked inside, no deity was there, but there were many
maggots. So the man, taking his broken tom-tom, went home.</p>
<p>In a few days afterwards, a rain having fallen, the Elephant&rsquo;s
carcase floated, and went down into the water-course. From the
water-course it passed down to the stream. A flock of crows covered the
carcase. As they were going eating and eating the dead body, it
descended into the river, and from the river it passed down to the
great sea. There the skin having rotted began to fall to the bottom.
After the crows had looked [around], there was not even a tree [to be
seen], and before they were able to fly to a place where there were
trees their wings were broken, and they died.</p>
<p class="storyLocation"><i>Washerman. North-western Province.</i></p>
<p>A variant related in another village is nearly the same. Some
tom-tom beaters passing the Elephant&rsquo;s carcase were accosted by
the Jackal, to whom they replied that they were going to &ldquo;a
p&#333;ya tom-tom beating,&rdquo; that is, one given on the Buddhist
sabbath, at the quarter of the moon. When he inquired what profit they
would get from it, they stated that they would receive cakes and
milk-rice. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want cakes and milk-rice,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I will give you gold. Bring water to this Elephant&rsquo;s
carcase.&rdquo; They did so, breaking open the &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; of
their tom-toms for the purpose, and the Jackal escaped.</p>
<p>The story concludes: &ldquo;For the tom-tom beaters there was
neither gold, nor cakes and milk-rice. Having broken their tom-toms,
lamenting and lamenting they went to their village.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">In the J&#257;taka story No. 148 (vol. i, p. 315), a
Jackal became imprisoned in the same way, but escaped when a tempest
soaked the skin. The tale is also given in No. 490 (vol. iv, p. 206).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=

<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i>
(Tawney), vol. i, p. 77</span>, a man crept inside the skin of an
Elephant from which jackals had eaten the flesh. A rain-storm caused it
to contract (?) and closed the aperture. The flood carried it into the
Ganges and thence to the sea. There a Garu&#7693;a [Rukh] picked it up,
and took it to Ceylon, where the man escaped when it tore open the
hide. I insert the following as an account of the supposed state of
things in Ceylon under the rule of Vibh&#299;sana, the R&#257;kshasa
King of Ceylon, after the death of R&#257;vana: &ldquo;Two
R&#257;kshasas contemplated him from a distance with feelings of
fear.&rdquo; They reported his arrival to Vibh&#299;sana, who sent for
him and entertained him in a friendly and hospitable manner. When asked
how he came to Ceylon, the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a cunningly replied that
he had been sent by Vishnu, who had informed him that Vibh&#299;sana
would present him with wealth. He stayed some time in the island, and
was allowed a young Garu&#7693;a on which to ride about the country,
and at last he was carried back to Mathur&#257; by it.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Old Deccan Days</i> (Frere), p. 179</span>,
a Jackal got inside a dead bullock, and informed the scavengers who
came to bury it that he was the god of their village. They poured water
on the hide, and he escaped.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Folk Tales</i> (Gordon), p.
61</span>, a live Elephant swallowed a Jackal. The Jackal fed on the
heart and killed the Elephant, but was imprisoned inside when the skin
dried up. When the God Mah&#257;deo (&#346;iva), who was passing, heard
cries and inquired who was there, the Jackal, after ascertaining who it
was, said that he was Sahadeo, father of Mah&#257;deo, and induced the
latter to prove his identity by causing a heavy rainfall, owing to
which the skin was softened and he escaped. <span class=

"#xd26e7017" name="xd26e7017src">1</a> In the North-western Province
the same opinion is held regarding some of them. To what extent it is
justified I am unable to say, but an example which supported the
general notion fell under my own observation. Some jungle was being cut
for an irrigation channel, at the side of an uncultivated field
belonging to a tom-tom beaters&rsquo; village, and one of the men came
to watch the progress of the work. I questioned him regarding eggs. He
stated at first that only things which could fly laid eggs, but he
admitted that this rule did not apply to crocodiles, lizards, and
snakes. About bats he was not certain, but thought they do not lay
eggs. Rats certainly do not lay them, he said.</p>
<p>I had seen a Green Bee-eater flying near us, and I observed a small
hole such as this bird makes as its nest-hole, in the sandy ground. I
drew his attention to it, and he at once asserted that it was a
rat-hole; of that he had no doubt whatever. &ldquo;Well then, let us
see if there are any eggs in it,&rdquo; I said, knowing that it was
then the breeding season of the Bee-eaters.</p>
<p>He looked on, smiling ironically, while I got one of my men to open
the tunnel carefully. When he came to the end, there on the sand, in a
little saucer-shaped cavity, were four shining, spherical white eggs of
the bird. The man was astonished, but was quite satisfied that they
were rat&rsquo;s eggs. &ldquo;I saw them with my two eyes,&rdquo; he
said to my men, who all laughed at him.</p>
<p>The following stories were written for me as the foolish doings
traditionally attributed to the tom-tom beaters of a village in the

wandered about eating, and at last lay down near a stream. The man
being tired out also lay down, and fell asleep. He was close to his own

Raju), p. 61</span>, twelve pigs crossed a stream, and counting
themselves in the same way on the opposite bank, thought that one had
been drowned.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i>
(Swynnerton), p. 305</span>, seven Buneyr men [weavers] counted their
number as six, and were so delighted when a shepherd proved that there
were seven that they insisted on doing a month&rsquo;s free labour for
him. Next day, however, one killed his mother in driving a fly off her
face, and another chopped off the heads of several goats for mocking
him by chewing their cud while he was eating, so he dispensed with the
rest of their services.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Adventures of the Guru Paramarta</i>
(Dubois, 1872)</span> the Guru and his five foolish disciples, after
long delay because of the danger, crossed a river in which the water
was only knee-deep. On reaching the far bank one of them counted the
party several times, omitting himself, and they concluded that one had
been drowned in the river, which they had heard was a treacherous one.
They lamented, and cursed the river, one after another, until a
traveller arrived. When he had heard their story he offered to restore
the missing man to them by means of magic, for which service they
agreed to pay him all the money they had, forty panams of gold. He said
to the Guru, &ldquo;It is a very little thing in comparison with the
service that I promise to render you. However, as you say it is all
that you possess, and as you are in other respects a good man who does
not intend any malice thereby, I consent.&rdquo; He set the six persons
in a row, and struck each one a good blow on the back with his stick as
he counted him in a loud voice.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Laughable Stories</i>, of Bar-Hebraeus
(Budge)</span>, the counting tale is No. 569. A man counted his asses
and found there were ten, then having mounted on one he omitted it, and
made the number nine. He dismounted and found there were ten; mounted
again and counted only nine. He got down again, and saw that there were
ten. Then saying, &ldquo;Verily there is a devil in me, for whenever I
mount an ass I lose one of them,&rdquo; he went on foot for fear of
losing one permanently.</p>
<p>The counting incident is found in China also. In <span class=
"bibl"><i>A String of Chinese Peach-Stones</i>, by W. A. Cornaby, p.
276</span>, a stupid Yamun underling who was taking a rascally monk to
prison, kept counting the things he had with him, &ldquo;Bundle,
umbrella, cangue (the heavy wooden collar on the prisoner&rsquo;s
neck), warrant, monk, myself.&rdquo; On the way he got drunk and went
to sleep. The monk took advantage of the opportunity to shave his head
and place the cangue on his neck, after which he absconded. When the
man awoke, and began to count the things, he found everything there but
himself. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=

together, were going away to Puttalam, it became night while they were
on the road. Having got a resting-place, and cooked and eaten, while
they were sleeping a tusk elephant appeared to a man in a dream.</p>
<p>On the morning of the following day the man said to the other men,
&ldquo;Friends, last night I saw an evil dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men asked, &ldquo;What was in the dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;I saw a tusk elephant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the men began to interpret the dream. They said, &ldquo;What is
the meaning? If there is a tusk elephant there will be elephant&rsquo;s
dung; if elephant&rsquo;s dung, paddy [which the elephant has eaten];
if paddy, uncooked rice; if uncooked rice, cooked rice; if cooked rice,
it is a thing [found only] in the village. Therefore the elephant means
the village. Something must have happened. It is useless for us to go
on. Let us go back to the village.&rdquo; So all, weeping and weeping,
set out to return to the village.</p>
<p>As they came to the rice field of the village, the women and boys of
the village having heard the men coming crying and crying aloud, said,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Our men are coming crying and crying. What is it? It
will be a dreadful thing.&rdquo; So the women and boys, having come
from the houses to that side of the field before those men came across,
began to cry also.</p>
<p>On seeing them, the man who saw the dream said to those other men,
&ldquo;Look there! Did I tell you falsely?&rdquo; Then the men cried
the more. Having seen it, these boys and women, they also cried more
and more. The two parties <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href=
"#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>having come quite near each other
still cried. The women and boys on that side of the stile [at the edge
of the field], these men on the field side of it, except that they
cried said nothing.</p>
<p>While they were crying and crying until it became night, as a man
from another village was going along the path he heard this uproar, and
came to see what it was. He asked at the hand of the men, &ldquo;What
is it? Who is dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the men, crying and crying, said, &ldquo;Who is dead we
don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the man having gone near those women and boys, asked,
&ldquo;What is it? Who is dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then those persons also said, crying and crying, &ldquo;Who is dead
we don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the man having stopped the crying of both parties, when
he had asked them about it, there was nothing dreadful. So the man went
away, and these men and women and boys, they also went to their
houses.</p>

friends would lament! The thought of it made her cry. When her aunts

When a neighbour asked the men what it was about, who was dead? they
could not tell him, but referred him to the women. He then learnt that
these also did not know, but cried because they saw the girl crying.

<h2 class="main">The Four Tom-tom Beaters</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This story is told in the Southern Province to
illustrate the foolishness of this caste.</p>
<p>Four Tom-tom Beaters when proceeding along a road together, met a
man of lower caste than themselves. Before passing them he made an
obeisance, and (as usual in such cases) said, &ldquo;Awasara,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Permission&rdquo;&mdash;that is, &ldquo;Have I permission (to
pass)?&rdquo;&mdash;and then walked away.</p>
<p>While the Tom-tom Beaters were going along afterwards a dispute
arose over it, each person claiming that he was the one who had been
addressed, and to whom the obeisance had been made, as being the
superior man of the party. Each maintaining his own view, and being
unable to settle it in any other way, the four persons decided to refer
the matter to the man himself. They therefore turned back and ran after
him, and on overtaking him requested him to state from which of them he
had asked the permission. As the question plainly indicated the sort of
persons they were, he replied, &ldquo;From the biggest fool among
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This left matters just where they were, as each one, in order to
prove his claim to the obeisance, then declared himself to be the
greatest fool; and at last they related their foolish actions. These
were pointless, and I did not preserve the details. Each, however, had
two wives, this being one of the grounds on which all based their
claims, and the details they gave consisted of accounts of the
ill-treatment that they received from these women.</p>

<p class="first">In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Nights&rsquo;
Entertainment</i> (Swynnerton), p. 65</span>, a traveller threw four
pence to four weavers, each of whom claimed all the money. A second
traveller&rsquo;s reasonable suggestion that each should take a penny
was rejected, and they ran after the man, and asked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>for
whom he had given them. When he inquired which was the wisest they told
stories that only indicated their extreme stupidity, and in the end he
gave them four pence each, all being equal in this respect.</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; Dubois gave a similar story from the Tamil of
Southern India, the men being four Br&#257;hma&#7751;as to whom a
soldier said, &ldquo;Sara&#7751;am, eiyar&rdquo; (&ldquo;Homage,
Sir&rdquo;). The four replied, &ldquo;&#256;sirv&#257;tam&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Benediction&rdquo;), and the man went off. After disputing
about it, they ran after him for a league, and asked him whom he
saluted. He said, &ldquo;Well, it is the biggest fool of four whom I
intended to salute.&rdquo; Eventually the matter was referred to the
headmen of the next village, who after hearing their accounts of their
silly deeds, decided that each one might claim superiority over the
others. &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;each one of you has
gained his case.&rdquo; The men were satisfied, as each had won.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of Hindustan</i> (Shaik Chilli),
p. 1</span>, there is a version in which two men were saluted by an old
woman as they passed her. After a dispute over it, when they ran back
and asked her about it, she replied that she saluted the greater fool
of the two. Then they related their experiences to her, and she
adjudged one to be a bigger fool than the other. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Golden Tree</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain city there is a King, it is said; there
are three Princes of that King. The King, while sleeping, saw in a
dream that a Golden Tree sprang up, and on that Golden Tree a Silver
Flower blossomed. A Silver Cock that was sitting on the Silver Flower
crowed.</p>
<p>Afterwards the King caused the three Princes to be fetched. When the
eldest Prince had been brought he asked him, &ldquo;Son, can you
explain this dream which I have had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;What appeared in the dream,
Father-King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;A Golden Tree having been created, on it a
Silver Flower blossomed, and a Silver Cock crowed while sitting upon
the flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Father-King, I cannot interpret
it; perhaps my two younger brothers will explain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King having caused the next Prince to be fetched, asked
him, &ldquo;Son, can you explain this dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;Father-King, what appeared in the
dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King told him the manner in which the things appeared in the
dream.</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;Father-King, I cannot explain it; perhaps
younger brother will interpret it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King having caused the youngest Prince to be brought asked
him, &ldquo;Son, can you explain this dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;Father-King, what appeared in the
dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King told him the manner in which the things appeared in the
dream. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;O Lord, Your Majesty, I will interpret
that dream, but I must first go in search of the
explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the three Princes obtained leave of absence for three
years. Having got it, the three persons, cooking a bundle of rice, and
taking from their father permission to depart, started to go in search
of the interpretation. Having gone on and on, they came to a junction
of three roads. Having arrived at it, and eaten the bundle of cooked
rice, the eldest Prince said, &ldquo;I will go along this road; you go
on those two roads<span class="corr" id="xd26e7283" title=
"Source: ,">.</span>&rdquo; So the eldest Prince went along one road,
the second Prince went along another road, and the youngest Prince went
on the remaining road.</p>
<p>Having gone on and on, the youngest Prince arrived at the house of a
widow woman. The woman said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, what have you come
here for? We have not even firewood for cooking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;Why, mother, is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow woman said, &ldquo;There is a Yak&#257; in the jungle in
which is the firewood. The Yak&#257; has now eaten all the people of
this city; few people are now in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;How does that Yak&#257; seize the
men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow woman said, &ldquo;When they go to the jungle and are
cutting firewood, he comes saying &lsquo;H&#363;,&rsquo; and eats
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Prince, taking his sword, went to the jungle, and
chopped a piece of firewood. The Yak&#257; came, saying
&ldquo;H&#363;.&rdquo; Then the Prince chopped at the Yak&#257; with
that very sword, and the Yak&#257; died there. After that, the Prince,
taking a bundle of firewood, returned to the house of the widow
woman.</p>
<p>The widow woman asked, &ldquo;Son, did you meet with the
Yak&#257;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I met with him; I killed the
Yak&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then having cooked with the firewood, she gave the Prince to
eat.</p>
<p>On the morning of the following day the King went to the jungle, and
chopped firewood. That day the Yak&#257; did not come, saying
&ldquo;H&#363;.&rdquo; Afterwards, through the Yak&#257;&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>not saying &ldquo;H&#363;,&rdquo; the King went
to look for him, and saw that the Yak&#257; was dead. So the King
returned to the city, and saying, &ldquo;I must find now, in a moment,
the man who killed the Yak&#257;,&rdquo; caused proclamation to be made
by beat of tom-toms to that effect.</p>
<p>Having heard it, this widow woman, summoning the Prince, went to the
palace, and told the King that he had killed the Yak&#257;. After that
the King asked at the hand of the Prince, &ldquo;How did you kill the
Yak&#257;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I went to the jungle, and while I was
chopping firewood the Yak&#257; having come crying
&ldquo;H&#363;,&rdquo; sprang onto me. Then I speedily chopped at him
and killed him.&rdquo; Having heard this, the King gave the Prince a
district of that kingdom, and an elephant&rsquo;s load of goods.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Prince gave all those things to the widow woman, and
having gone away to another city, came to the house of a widow-mother.
Having arrived there, the Prince said to her, &ldquo;An&#275;! Mother,
you must give me a resting-place to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow-mother said, &ldquo;I can indeed give you a resting-place,
but there is no place to sleep in. You cannot sleep in the veranda; a
light falls there during the night, and any person who sees that light
dies. Nobody can stop the light. In order to stop it, the King has made
public proclamation by beat of tom-toms that to any person who stops it
he will give an elephant&rsquo;s load of goods, and a district of the
kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked her, &ldquo;Mother, where does the light fall
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow-mother said, &ldquo;In an open grass field in the middle
of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince then said, &ldquo;If so, go and tell the King to fix a
raised platform at the place where the light falls, and having placed
there a winnowing basket made of cow-dung, and a large pot of water, to
come away. I will go there to-night and stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the widow-mother went and told the King. After that, the King
prepared the things in that very manner, and came away. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the evening, the Prince, having eaten food, went onto the
platform. Near midnight, while he was there the light fell there. When
the Prince looked, the N&#257;ga King of the world of the N&#257;gas,
having come there, had ejected from his mouth the Cobra Stone, and
having gone far away was eating food [as a cobra].</p>
<p>Then this Prince put the cow-dung winnowing basket on the stone,
whereupon the N&#257;ga King came crying out to the water-pot, taking
it for the person [who had done it]. The Prince then chopped at him
with his sword, and the N&#257;ga King died. After that, taking the
Cobra Stone, the Prince washed it with water from the pot, and put it
away in the waist pocket of his cloth.</p>
<p>While he was there it became light. Then the King came to see if he
had stopped the light. When he looked he saw that the cobra was lying
in a heap. The King asked at the hand of the Prince, &ldquo;Did you
stop the light?&rdquo; The Prince said, &ldquo;Look there! The very one
that made the light has been killed there.&rdquo; Afterwards the King
gave the Prince an elephant&rsquo;s load of goods, and a district of
that kingdom.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Prince having given to the widow woman all the
things that had been given to him, went along the path on which the
N&#257;ga King had come, to the world of the N&#257;gas. When he got
there, all the three Princesses of the N&#257;ga King whom he had
killed were there, sitting in one spot.</p>
<p>The Princesses said to this Prince, &ldquo;What have you come for?
Should our father the King return now he will eat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince saying, &ldquo;Your father the King cannot come. I have
come here after killing your father the King,&rdquo; showed them the
Cobra Stone.</p>
<p>Then the Princesses asked, &ldquo;What have you come here
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I have come on account of a sooth-saying, in
order to get it explained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princesses asked, &ldquo;What is the sooth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;At the time when our father the King was
sleeping, a Golden Tree having sprung up, and a Silver <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>Flower having blossomed on it, a Silver Cock
which was sitting upon the flower crowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three Princesses said, &ldquo;We cannot explain it here. Let us
go to your father the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and the three Princesses and
the Prince set off to come to him.</p>
<p>They came to the junction of the three roads at which at first the
three Princes separated. Having arrived there they went along the road
on which the eldest brother of the Prince had gone, and having met with
him the Prince said, &ldquo;Let us go back, elder brother, these three
Princesses will explain the dream&rdquo;; so they returned. Then they
all went along the road on which the next brother had gone, and having
found him the Prince said, &ldquo;Let us go back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having summoned him to go with them, those three Princes and the
three Princesses, six persons, having met together in this manner, came
to the Princes&rsquo; city. Having arrived there, this youngest Prince
caused their father the King to be called. So the King came to
them.</p>
<p>Then these three Princesses who had come from the world of the
N&#257;gas said to this youngest Prince, &ldquo;Cause us three persons
to stand at the thread&rdquo; (that is, to toe the line). So this
Prince caused them to stand at the thread.</p>
<p>Then the three Princesses said, &ldquo;Cut off our three heads at
one stroke.&rdquo; So this youngest Prince cut off their three heads at
one stroke. Thereupon the Golden Tree was created, and the Silver
Flower having blossomed on it, the Silver Cock that was sitting on the
top of the flower crowed.</p>
<p>Then this youngest Prince chopped down the Golden Tree with his
sword, and the three Princesses came to life again. Having come to
life, the three Princesses asked at the hand of the King, the father of
the Princes, &ldquo;Was it thus in the dream that appeared to
you?&rdquo; The King said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Then the three Princesses
told him that they were the Golden Tree, and the Silver Flower, and the
Silver Cock.</p>
<p>After that, the three Princesses, having been married to the three
Princes, remained there.</p>

trap on him, and killed him. When she went to wash the diamond in the
lake, the water on being touched by it rolled aside, and revealed a

and swallowed the two horses of a Prince and his friend, the son of the
Minister, who were belated, and sitting in a tree. While the snake was
at some distance, the Minister&rsquo;s son descended, covered the gem
with horse dung, and climbed back. The snake rushed to the spot, but

<h2 class="main">The Seven Princesses</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a King and a Queen, it
is said; there are seven Princesses [the daughters] of the King. A
Prince younger than those seven is born.</p>
<p>The King went to a war, and having gone there the King was defeated
in the war. When he returned, the royal food was not made ready for the
King. Having arrived, he asked the Queen, &ldquo;Why did you not
prepare the royal food for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Queen said, &ldquo;I cannot bring up your children, and
prepare the royal food for you also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;Why? What have the Princesses
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen replied, &ldquo;They go to the river, and after bathing
there come back and rub oil on their heads, and comb their hair,
[instead of assisting me to prepare the food].&rdquo;</p>
<p>On account of that the King settled to behead the seven royal
Princesses next day.</p>
<p>The Queen having cooked a bundle of rice and given it to those seven
said, &ldquo;Go to any place you like, or the King will behead you
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, they went off to the river, and after sitting there and
eating the bundle of rice, the seven went away.</p>
<p>Having gone on and on, they went to the house of a R&#257;kshasa.
When they got there the R&#257;kshasa was not at home. The seven
persons asked for and obtained a resting place from the
R&#257;kshas&#299; (female R&#257;kshasa). Then the youngest Princess
said, &ldquo;We have no food; give us something to cook.&rdquo; So the
R&#257;kshas&#299; gave them a little paddy.</p>
<p>The youngest Princess, taking the paddy, said to the other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>six Princesses, &ldquo;Elder sisters, come and
pound this small quantity of paddy.&rdquo; The six persons refused.</p>
<p>After that, the Princess having pounded it, when she went out to
winnow it saw that there was a heap of human bones behind the house.
The Princess bearing that in mind winnowed it, and returned without
speaking about them. Then she called the Princesses to come and cook
it; they did not come.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Princess having cooked, summoned those six persons to
eat the rice. The six persons refused. Thereupon the Princess fed the
six Princesses [by dividing the rice and giving each one her share of
it].</p>
<p>Now, in the evening the seven Princesses went to sleep. There were
seven girls at the house, the daughters of the R&#257;kshasa, and the
seven wore white clothes. The seven Princesses wore blue clothes. Then
the youngest Princess having awoke in the night, took the seven white
cloths of the seven R&#257;kshasa girls, and put them on the
Princesses, placing the dark cloths of the Princesses on the girls.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa having returned during the night, and having
learnt from his wife of the arrival of the Princesses, put one of the
girls out of those who wore the dark cloths, in a large cooking-pot,
and having boiled her the R&#257;kshasa ate his own daughter.</p>
<p>After seeing this, when the R&#257;kshasa had gone to sleep, the
little Princess, awaking those six Princesses, told them about it, and
all the Princesses escaped together during the night. Having come to a
river they remained there lying on a sandbank.</p>
<p>A King having come that way while they were there, asked, &ldquo;Are
you Yak&#257;s or human beings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princesses asked, &ldquo;Is it a Yak&#257; or a human being who
asks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King replied, &ldquo;It is indeed a human being who asks, not a
Yak&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princesses said, &ldquo;We indeed are human beings, not
Yak&#257;s,&rdquo; [and they told him how they had escaped from the
house of the R&#257;kshasa and had come there].</p>
<p>On hearing this the King said, &ldquo;Can you go with me?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Princesses having said, &ldquo;We can,&rdquo; went with the King
to his palace, and became his Queens.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7474src" href="#xd26e7474" name="xd26e7474src">1</a></p>
<p>On the night of the following day, a daughter of the R&#257;kshasa,
having heard how the King had taken away the Princesses, came there,
and remained lying on the sandbank.</p>
<p>On the next day, also, the King having come that way asked,
&ldquo;Are you a Yak&#257; or a human being?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s daughter said, &ldquo;Is it a Yak&#257; or
a human being who asks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King replied, &ldquo;It is indeed a human being who asks, not a
Yak&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s daughter said, &ldquo;I also am indeed a
human being, not a Yak&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;If so, can you go with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshas&#299; having said, &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; went with
the King to the palace, [and also became his wife.]</p>
<p>After a long time had gone by, all those seven Princesses were about
to have children. One night, when the Princesses were asleep, the
R&#257;kshas&#299; plucked out the eyes of the seven Princesses by
magic, without awaking them, and having done so hid all the eyes. Then
when the seven Princesses, having arisen, tried to go about, they were
unable to go; they found that they could not see, so they lay down
again.</p>
<p>Afterwards the King came to awake them. &ldquo;Why<a id="xd26e7495"
name="xd26e7495"></a> are you sleeping yet?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The seven Princesses replied, &ldquo;We are unable to get up; we
have no eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;How have your eyes become
displaced?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seven Princesses said, &ldquo;What has happened we do not know;
they have been plucked out while we were asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the King having said, &ldquo;If so, go where you
like,&rdquo; drove them away. The King allowed only the
R&#257;kshas&#299; to stay.</p>
<p>The seven Princesses, having gone on and on, and having fallen down
at a pool, gave birth to seven Princes there. Now, there was no food
for the seven, so having cut up the Prince of the eldest Princess, and
divided the body into seven parts, they ate for a day. On the next day,
having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>cut up the next Princess&rsquo;s Prince and
divided the body<span class="corr" id="xd26e7510" title=
"Not in source">,</span> they ate it. Thus, in that manner they ate the
six Princes of the six persons.</p>
<p>On the next day they settled to cut up the Prince of the youngest
Princess. Then the youngest Princess, on each of the days having put
away her portions of flesh, said, &ldquo;You shall not cut up my
Prince. Look, here is your flesh,&rdquo; she said, and gave them the
six portions of flesh. The six persons ate them. [The narrator did not
state how they subsisted after that.]</p>
<p>While this youngest Princess was rearing that Prince there, after
the Prince went to the chena jungle one day, he met with a Vaedd&#257;.
The Vaedd&#257; said, &ldquo;Let us go together to the King&rsquo;s
city.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7517src" href="#xd26e7517"
name="xd26e7517src">2</a> The Prince said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and
went with him. There the King saw him, and being pleased with him gave
him food and the like. The Prince having eaten, after he had come again
to the pool the Prince&rsquo;s mother asked, &ldquo;Where did you
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a id="xd26e7521" name="xd26e7521"></a>The Prince said, &ldquo;I
went to the King&rsquo;s city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mother asked, &ldquo;What did you go for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince replied, &ldquo;I went &lsquo;simply&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;
(that is, for no special purpose).</p>
<p>The Princess having said, &ldquo;Ah&#257;!&rdquo; while she was
still there the Prince said, &ldquo;I am going to the forge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gone to the forge he said to the smith, &ldquo;Make and give
me a bow and an arrow.&rdquo; The smith said, &ldquo;Cut a stick and
come with it.&rdquo; So the Prince went to the chena jungle to cut a
stick. There was no suitable stick, but a golden shoot had fallen down
there, and having taken it he gave it to the smith. The smith said,
&ldquo;This is not good; bring another stick,&rdquo; so the Prince went
and brought another stick. The smith made a good bow and arrow out of
the stick, and gave them to him.</p>
<p>Then the Prince having taken the bow and arrow, and shot a deer,
carried it to the city. After he had gone there they gave him paddy,
rice, flesh, and cooking-pots, and the like for it. Then the Prince
having taken them to the pool where the Princesses were, gave them to
his mother the Queen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>Afterwards he shot a deer every
day, and having taken it to the city carried back to the Princesses the
things that he received for it.</p>
<p>One day having shot a deer, as he was about to take it to the city
the Prince&rsquo;s mother told him to carry it to the palace. While he
was there the R&#257;kshas&#299; saw him, and having made inquiry got
to know that he was the son of the youngest Princess. So she said to
him, &ldquo;Take a letter to our house for me,&rdquo; and gave it to
him.</p>
<p>As the Prince was going that day taking the letter, it became night,
so he went to a city, and asked a widow woman for a resting-place for
the night. The woman of the house said, &ldquo;An&#275;! What have you
come to this city for? A Yak&#257; has eaten all who were in this city.
To-night he will be coming for my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;How will the Yak&#257; come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;Four miles away he says,
&lsquo;H&#363;&rsquo;; then a mile away he says, &lsquo;H&#363;&rsquo;;
and having come from there near the stile at the road, he says,
&lsquo;H&#363;&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;Are there Kaekuna<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7546src" href="#xd26e7546" name="xd26e7546src">3</a> seeds
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The daughter said, &ldquo;There are,&rdquo; and she gave him a
sackful of them.</p>
<p>Then he told the daughter, whose father had been the King of the
city, not to be afraid. &ldquo;If the Yak&#257; should come I will kill
him,&rdquo; he said. So the Prince went to sleep, placing a sword that
he had brought at his side, and laying his head on the waist pocket of
the Princess.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Yak&#257; cried &ldquo;H&#363;,&rdquo; when four
miles away, and tears fell from the eyes of the Princess on the breast
of the Prince when she heard it. Next, the Yak&#257; cried
&ldquo;H&#363;,&rdquo; when a mile away. The Princess having spoken
words to him on hearing it, he arose. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he
asked. The Princess said, &ldquo;The Yak&#257; is coming.&rdquo; Then
the Prince emptied the sack of Kaekuna seeds at the door, and took up
his sword.</p>
<p>As the Yak&#257;, having come, was springing into the doorway, he
slipped on the seeds, and fell. Thereupon the Prince cut and killed the
Yak&#257; with his sword, and having <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>put his body in a
well which was there, covered it up with earth.</p>
<p>After the Prince had told the Princess about himself and the seven
Princesses, he said, &ldquo;I must go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess asked him, &ldquo;What else is there in your
hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince replied, &ldquo;There is a letter which the Queen has
ordered me to take to her home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess having said, &ldquo;Where is it? Let me look at
it,&rdquo; took it, and when she looked at it there was written in it,
&ldquo;Mother, eat the Prince who brings this letter, and eat the eyes
of those seven persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Princess having torn up the letter, wrote another letter,
&ldquo;Mother, having taken care of the Prince who brings this letter,
send medicine for the eyes of those seven persons.&rdquo; Having
written it she gave it into the hands of the Prince.</p>
<p>The Prince carrying the letter, and having taken a bundle of cooked
rice to eat on the way, went to the house of the R&#257;kshas&#299;. As
he was coming near the house he saw a <span class="corr" id="xd26e7573"
title="Source: Rakshas&#299;">R&#257;kshas&#299;</span> sitting at the
road. When she saw him she said, &ldquo;The flesh of that one who is
coming is for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;What art thou saying?&rdquo; and gave the
letter to the R&#257;kshas&#299;, and asked for the medicine for the
eyes. After reading the letter the R&#257;kshas&#299; prepared abundant
food for him, and gave him lodgings that day.</p>
<p>Next day, showing him a tree, she said, &ldquo;After you have rubbed
the juice of this tree on the eyes of the persons who are blind, their
eyes will become well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;If so, tie a little of it in a packet and
give me it.&rdquo; So the R&#257;kshas&#299; having tied up a packet of
it gave him it.</p>
<p>Then the Prince having taken it back, rubbed it on the eyes of those
seven persons, and their eyes became well.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Prince having gone with them to the city where he
killed the Yak&#257;, married the Princess, and remained there.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This story does not appear to have been met with among
the people of Southern India, but variants are well-known in other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>parts of the country. In all these forms of the
tale the wicked R&#257;kshasa Queen is killed.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Fairy Stories</i> (Ganges Valley),
by Miss Stokes</span>, there are two variants, pp. 51 and 176. In both,
a demoness or R&#257;kshas&#299; whom the King married induced him to
cause the eyes of his other seven Queens to be plucked out, and six of
the infants whom they bore were eaten, the seventh being saved as in
Ceylon.</p>
<p>In one story the boy was sent for the milk of a tigress, an
eagle&rsquo;s feather, and night-growing rice; in the other he went for
rose-water, flowers, and a dress. A friendly Fak&#299;r in one tale,
and a Princess in the other, substituted other letters for those in
which the demons or ogres were instructed to kill him, so that he was
well received and succeeded in his errands. In one case he got the
blind Queens&rsquo; eyes, and ointment to make them as before; in the
other he brought back magic water that cured them.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Punjab</i> (Steel), p.
89</span>, and <span class="bibl"><i>Wide-Awake Stories</i> (Steel and
Temple), p. 98</span>, the demoness Queen persuaded the King to give
her the eyes of the seven Queens, which she strung as a necklace for
her mother. The seventh boy, who was shooting game for the blind
Queens&rsquo; food, was sent for the eyes and got thirteen, one having
been eaten. The written message which requested that he should be
killed was changed by a Princess. On two other journeys he obtained the
J&#333;g&#299;&rsquo;s white cow which gave milk unceasingly, and rice
that bore a million-fold, by the aid of which the seven Queens became
the richest people in the kingdom. After he had married the Princess
who assisted him, the King heard the whole story, and killed the
demoness.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of Bengal</i> (Day), p.
117</span>, the R&#257;kshasa Queen, after getting the seven
Queens&rsquo; eyes plucked out, ate up all the people, and no one
remained to attend on the King. At last the boy offered his services.
He always left before night, the time when the Ogress caught her
victims. She sent him to her mother for a melon, with a letter which he
tore up. He got back safely, bringing a bird in which was the life of
the Ogress Queen; when he killed it she died.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Indian Antiquary</i>, vol. i, p.
170</span>, there is a Bengal story by Mr. G. H. Damant. The Ogress or
R&#257;kshasa Queen obtained the eyes of the seven Queens from the
King, and sent the boy for sea-foam, and afterwards for rice grown in
Ceylon, &ldquo;the home of the R&#257;kshasas,&rdquo; that ripened in
one day. A Sanny&#257;si, or Hindu religious mendicant, changed him
into a kingfisher on one trip and a parrot on the other, which brought
the things, being re-converted into a Prince on the way back. Lastly,
he was sent to Ceylon for a cow a cubit long and half a cubit high. The
King paid him heavily for getting these things, and for the last one
was obliged to sell his kingdom and give the proceeds to the boy. The
Sanny&#257;si instructed him to conciliate a R&#257;kshas&#299; by
addressing her as &ldquo;Aunt,&rdquo; and to deliver a pretended
message from the Ogress Queen. He was well <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>received, and learnt that the
R&#257;kshasas&rsquo; lives were in a lemon and the Ogress
Queen&rsquo;s in a bird. He cut the lemon and thus killed all the
R&#257;kshasas, brought back the blind Queens&rsquo; eyes, and killed
the bird, and with it the Ogress Queen.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of Hindustan</i>, Allahabad
(Shaik Chilli), p. 105</span>, the seven Queens were thrown into a
large dry well; it is not stated that their eyes were plucked out. The
seventh boy got his grandfather, a carpenter, to make him a wooden
flying horse. He was sent for singing-water, magic rice, and news of
the R&#257;kshasa Queen&rsquo;s relatives. He met a lion, a wolf, and
various other savage animals, which he appeased by addressing them as
&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; etc. A kind Y&#333;g&#299;
changed his letter, and he was welcomed by the R&#257;kshasas, whose
lives he learnt were in a number of birds. These he killed, taking back
a pea-hen in which lay the life of the Ogress Queen, as well as the
magic water and rice. Each of the animals sent a cub with him, and on
his return these performed a dance, at the end of which he killed the
pea-hen and the Ogress died. The persons who had been eaten by the
Ogress revived when the magic water was sprinkled on their bones. The
magic rice plant, called Vanaspati, grew into a tree forty yards high,
and bore cooked rice.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of Kashmir</i> (Knowles), 2nd
ed., p. 43</span>, the seven Queens&rsquo; eyes were put out, and they
were thrown into a large dry well. The seventh boy was sent for the
milk of a tigress, and then to the grandparents of the Ogress Queen. A
friendly Fak&#299;r having altered the messages, he was well received,
got medicine that cured the blind Queens&rsquo; eyes, and also killed
the birds and smashed a spinning-wheel in which were the lives of the
Ogress Queen and her relatives.</p>
<p>At p. 446, also, the eyes of a Queen which had been plucked out were
replaced and healed.</p>
<p>A variant of the Western Province of Ceylon, in which there were
twelve Queens, whose sight was not regained, however, has been given
already. See No. 24. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city there are a King and a Queen, it is
said. There are six Princes. The youngest Prince of the six plays with
(<i>lit.</i> beats) the ashes on the ash-heap at the corner of the
hearth; the other five Princes are doing work, and going on journeys
together.</p>
<p>The King said at the hands of the Queen that he must behead the
Prince who was [idling] on the ash-heap. Then the Queen said,
&ldquo;What is the use of beheading him? Let us send the Prince whom we
do not want to any place where he likes to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having come to the Prince, the Queen says, &ldquo;Son, the King says
that he must behead you; on that account go away to any place you
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince said, &ldquo;If so, give me a bundle of cooked rice,
and a thousand masuran, in order to go and trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Queen gave him a package of cooked rice and a thousand
masuran.</p>
<p>The Prince took the masuran and the package of cooked rice, and
having gone on and on, when he was coming to a travellers&rsquo; shed
[saw that] a man was taking a brown Monkey,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7672src" href="#xd26e7672" name="xd26e7672src">1</a> in order to
throw it into the river. This Prince called the man, and the man
thereupon brought the Monkey and came to the travellers&rsquo;
shed.</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;Where are you taking that
Monkey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;I am taking this to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince asked, &ldquo;For how much will you give it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said he would give it for a thousand masuran. The Prince
gave the thousand masuran that were in his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>hands, and got the Monkey, and that man having
taken the thousand masuran went away.</p>
<p>The Prince having unfastened the package of cooked rice, and given
some to the Monkey also, and the Prince himself having eaten, took the
Monkey and came back to the very city of the King. When he came there
the King was not at the palace; only the Queen was there. The Queen
asked, &ldquo;What sort of goods have you brought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince says, &ldquo;Mother, having given that thousand masuran I
have brought a Monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Queen says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Son, should the King and the
rest of them get to know that, he will behead you and behead me. As you
have taken that Monkey put it away somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Prince took the Monkey and put it in a rock cave in the
jungle, and shutting the door came to the palace. While he was there
the King saw him, and having seen him, called the Queen and said,
&ldquo;I shall not allow that one to stay in my palace for even a
p&#257;&#275;ya (twenty minutes). I shall behead him
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Queen came to the Prince and said, &ldquo;Son, the
King says he must behead you to-morrow, therefore go to any place you
like, and do not come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;Give me a package of rice, and a thousand
masuran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Queen having cooked a package of rice gave him it,
and a thousand masuran. The Prince taking them, and having gone to the
rock cave where the Monkey was, took it and went to [another] city. At
that city he ate the package of rice at the travellers&rsquo; shed, and
having gone to the hearth the Prince slept on the ash-heap.</p>
<p>The Monkey went away to dance in cities. Having gone and danced,
collecting requisite articles, he came back to the place where the
Prince was, and the Prince cooked some of the things he brought, and
gave him to eat. The Monkey goes every day to dance; and having danced,
the Prince and Monkey, both of them, eat the things he brings. In that
way the Monkey brings things every day.</p>
<p>One day, the Monkey having gone to a city and danced, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>fell
down at the palace at that city. Then the King came and asked,
&ldquo;What is it, Monkey? Why have you fallen down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Monkey says, &ldquo;I have come to beg and take the
measure<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7708src" href="#xd26e7708" name=
"xd26e7708src">2</a> in which masuran are measured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the King gave him the measure for measuring masuran. The
monkey having taken it and having been absent for as much as a month,
brought the measure back.</p>
<p>Then the King asked, &ldquo;What is this, Monkey, that having taken
the measure thou hast been such a time [in returning it]?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Monkey says, &ldquo;For just so much time I measured
masuran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;Having measured them did you
finish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Monkey said, &ldquo;And&#333;! Could it be finished? Not
even a quarter was finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;Ah&#257;!&rdquo; and was silent.</p>
<p>The Monkey that day also having danced in that city, the King gave
him many presents. Taking them, and stealing a cloth from a field where
clothes were spread out [to dry], while he was coming a man having met
him in the road asked the Monkey, &ldquo;Monkey, to whom dost thou give
the articles that thou art taking every day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Monkey says, &ldquo;I give them to our Mr. Janel
Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;. I am supporting that gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Monkey having gone to the place where the Prince was, says,
&ldquo;Here is a cloth. It is good for the gentleman, is it not?&rdquo;
and he showed him the cloth which he had stolen.</p>
<p>The Prince threw it aside, and said, &ldquo;This cloth which I have
is enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day the Monkey having come to that city and danced, lay down on
the lawn of the palace. Then the King asked, &ldquo;What is it, Monkey,
that you have fallen down there for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Monkey says, &ldquo;Our Mr. Janel Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;
burnt his cloth while drinking. I have come to ask you to cause the
cloth to be woven for him [anew].&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;If so, bring it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Monkey having gone to the place where the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>Prince was, brought a thin cloth and gave it to
the King. Afterwards the King caused one to be woven, and gave it to
him.</p>
<p>Then the Monkey says at the hand of the King, &ldquo;You ought to
marry your Princess to our Mr. Janel
Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Monkey, begging two copper pots,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7750src" href="#xd26e7750" name="xd26e7750src">3</a> went away,
and having gone, heated water in the two copper pots, and having made
the Prince bathe, said to the Prince, &ldquo;Do not eat largely of the
sorts [of food] after I have cooked and given [the food] to you [at the
palace]. I have asked for a [Princess in] marriage for you after I went
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Monkey, summoning the Prince also, went to the palace
of the King of that city. Having gone there, and prepared a seat at the
King&rsquo;s table, and made ready the food, after the Prince sat down
to the food seven Princesses themselves began to divide [and serve]
it.</p>
<p>Then that Prince began to eat very plentifully. The Monkey having
come and nudged him with his finger, said, &ldquo;You have eaten
enough.&rdquo; Taking no notice of it, the Prince went on eating.
Having eaten that, he shaped his hand [into a cup] and reversing it
there [when full], ate in excess.</p>
<p>Then the King asked the Monkey, &ldquo;What, Monkey, is [the reason
of] that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Monkey said, &ldquo;Our Mr. Janel Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;
having been overheated [by his bath] could not eat. Through that indeed
it has befallen that he has lost his senses.&rdquo; That also the King
kept in mind.</p>
<p>Then the Prince and the King&rsquo;s eldest daughter were
married.</p>
<p>After that, the Monkey said that he wanted a thousand bill-hooks,
and a thousand digging-hoes, and a thousand axes, and a thousand
people. The King gave him a thousand bill-hooks, and a thousand
digging-hoes, and a thousand axes, and a thousand people. [With these
the royal party set off to deliver the Princess at the Prince&rsquo;s
palace.]</p>
<p>Afterwards, having given the tools to those people, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>Monkey goes in front. The King and the Princess
and the Prince come after. That Monkey goes [in the trees] jumping and
jumping, and changing branches. The thousand people went footing and
footing the road.</p>
<p>While going thus they met with a city. Then the King quietly told
the Monkey to halt; it stopped. Then the King asked the Monkey,
&ldquo;Whose is that city that is visible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Monkey says, &ldquo;This city is our Mr. Janel
Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;&rsquo;s. It has been rented out to his
work-people.&rdquo; Afterwards the King went on, keeping that also in
his mind.</p>
<p>The Monkey again went in front. Then again they met with a city.
Again the King having called the Monkey asked, &ldquo;Whose is that
city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Monkey says, &ldquo;It is our Mr. Janel
Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257;&rsquo;s. It has been rented out to his
<span class="corr" id="xd26e7779" title=
"Source: workpeople">work-people</span>. In that way are the cities
belonging to our Mr. Janel Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#257; [given
out].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the Monkey went off in front. Having gone thus, he went to the
house of a R&#257;kshasa, and having made the house ready in a second,
when he stepped aside the King and the Prince and Princess went in.</p>
<p>The King made the thousand <span class="corr" id="xd26e7786" title=
"Source: workpeople">work-people</span> stay there, and having handed
over the Princess, next day went back to his city.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Monkey asked at the hand of the Prince, &ldquo;For
the help that you gave me I also am assisting you. What favour besides
will you give me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince says, &ldquo;When you have died I shall weep
abundantly, and having made a coffin, and put you in the coffin, I will
bury you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Monkey said, &ldquo;So much indeed is the assistance I
want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day the Monkey lay down, trickishly saying that he was getting
fever. The Prince did not even go in that direction. Next day and the
next day he stayed there; on those days he did not go.</p>
<p>On the third day the Monkey cunningly shutting his eyes remained as
though he had died. The Prince said to a man, &ldquo;Look if that
Monkey is dead.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href=
"#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span></p>
<p>The man having gone near the Monkey, when he looked it was dead [in
appearance]; he said at the hand of the Prince that it was dead. The
Prince said, &ldquo;Having put a creeper round its neck, drag it in the
direction of that jungle, and having thrown it there come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the man tried to put the creeper on the Monkey&rsquo;s neck the
Monkey got up. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put the creeper on my neck,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Having gone near the Prince he said, &ldquo;After I was dead
[apparently], you were taking me without having put me in a coffin. Why
do you [arrange to] drag me, having put a creeper on my neck?
Don&rsquo;t take even so much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, the Monkey went off to the midst of the forest,
and died.</p>

<p class="first">In a certain country there are a man and a woman, it
is said. There is a girl (daughter) of those two persons.</p>
<p>The girl was asked [in marriage] for a Gamar&#257;la of another
country who had much wealth in money. The girl having been summoned,
and having gone to the Gamar&#257;la, and been with him for a long
time, he went to chop jungle [for making a chena]. There he met with a
fawn, and having returned home said to the girl, &ldquo;Bolan, there
was a fawn in the chena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl said, &ldquo;An&#275;! After you have gone to-morrow bring
it.&rdquo; On the following day the Gamar&#257;la brought it.</p>
<p>When the girl had reared it for a long time, a longing came to her,
and she lay down. Afterwards the Gamar&#257;la asked the Deer,
&ldquo;What, Deer, is thy elder sister&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Deer said, &ldquo;Our elder sister has a
longing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;What can she eat for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deer replied, &ldquo;Our elder sister can eat the stars in the
sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Gamar&#257;la, having gone to seek the stars, and to
seek for the corner of the sky [where it joined the earth, so as to
ascend to them], searched until he became aged, but was unable to find
the corner; and the Gamar&#257;la died.</p>
<p>Then the girl, having sold the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s village, took
the money that was obtained there, and the wealth that he possessed
[and left]. While the girl and the Deer were going on their way they
met with a King. He asked the Deer, &ldquo;Where, Deer, are ye
going?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Deer said, &ldquo;Our elder sister on account of thirst is going
to seek a little water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King said, &ldquo;Wilt thou give thy elder sister to me [in
marriage]?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deer said &ldquo;H&#257;&rdquo;; so having placed the Deer and
the Deer&rsquo;s elder sister on the back of the King&rsquo;s elephant,
they went to the palace.</p>
<p>When a long time had passed, a longing came again to the girl, and
she lay down.</p>
<p>The King asked the Deer, &ldquo;What is thy elder sister&rsquo;s
illness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deer said, &ldquo;Our elder sister has a longing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;What can she eat for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deer said, &ldquo;Should you bring for our elder sister the sand
which is at the bottom of the ocean, if she slept upon it she would be
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the King was going to the bottom of the sea to take
the sand, he was soaked with the water, and died.</p>
<p>After this, when the Deer and the Deer&rsquo;s elder sister, taking
all the King&rsquo;s things, and cooking a bundle of rice, were on
their way again, they met with a man. The man asked the Deer,
&ldquo;Where, Deer, are ye going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deer said<span class="corr" id="xd26e7873" title=
"Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;We are going to seek a man for our
elder sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;If so, give thy elder sister to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deer said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and the Deer and the
Deer&rsquo;s elder sister went to the man&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>When they had been there a long time, a longing came to the woman,
and she lay down. The man asked, &ldquo;What, Deer, is thy elder
sister&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deer said, &ldquo;Our elder sister has a longing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man asked, &ldquo;What can she eat for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deer said, &ldquo;Our elder sister must eat Nikini. Should she
not eat it, it will not only be very difficult for her [to recover];
her life will be lost.&rdquo; Now the sort called &ldquo;Nikini&rdquo;
is not in any place whatever in the world. That ignorant man, not
knowing of its non-existence, on account of the love that he bore for
his wife went away on a search for Nikini. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>Afterwards, when the foolish man was on his way to seek for Nikini,
a man was ploughing. The man who was ploughing asked, &ldquo;Where are
you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man said, &ldquo;I am going to seek for a little
Nikini.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man said to this man, &ldquo;If so, come here [and help me
to plough].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those two having ploughed during the whole of that day, went in the
evening to the house of the man who had been ploughing. Both of them
having eaten cooked rice, the man who went to seek for Nikini asked
that man, &ldquo;An&#275;! Now then, tell me the place where there is
Nikini.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;An&#275;! I don&rsquo;t know. Go you
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, when he had slept there that night, that man gave him a
little cooked rice. Having eaten a little, while he was going on his
way to seek for Nikini, a man was chopping earthen ridges in a rice
field. The man asked, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man said, &ldquo;I am going to seek for a little
Nikini.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then that man said, &ldquo;If so, come here [and help
me].&rdquo;</p>
<p>After those two persons had chopped the ridges during the whole day,
they went in the evening to the man&rsquo;s house. While they were
[there], having eaten cooked rice this man who went to seek for Nikini
said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Tell me the site where there is
Nikini.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;An&#275;! I don&rsquo;t know. Go and ask at the
hand of another person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this man had slept there that day night, on the next day that
man gave him a little cooked rice. Having eaten it he set off to go and
seek Nikini. Then a man was sowing a rice field. The man asked him,
&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man said, &ldquo;I am going to seek for a little
Nikini.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man asked, &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man replied, &ldquo;A longing has come to our house-mistress,
so she told me to go and bring a little Nikini.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;If so, come here and sow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the whole of that day those two sowed. In the evening they came
to the man&rsquo;s house, and both of them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>having eaten cooked rice, while they were there
this man said, &ldquo;Now then, tell me the place where there is
Nikini.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man said<span class="corr" id="xd26e7928" title=
"Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Yak&#333;,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7931src" href="#xd26e7931" name="xd26e7931src">2</a> that was not
[asked for] through want of Nikini. That was said through wanting to
cause you to be killed. Your wife has a paramour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man quarrelled with him, saying, &ldquo;Not in any way. My wife
is very good. She has great love for me. If you again say such a thing
as that one is there, I shall strike you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other man asked, &ldquo;What will you give me to catch that
paramour for you<span class="corr" id="xd26e7941" title=
"Source: .">?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person who went on the search for Nikini said, &ldquo;I have a
gem which has continued with us from generation to generation. I will
give you that gem.&rdquo; [The man accepted this offer].</p>
<p>Then the two persons made a cage called, &ldquo;The Cage of the God
Sivalinga,&rdquo; and tied white cloth in it [as a lining], and trimmed
a wooden cudgel and placed it inside. The man [who had gone for Nikini]
was also placed inside the cage with a cloth on his shoulders, and
closed in with similar cloths. Men having been fetched [and engaged to
carry it]&mdash;saying that he was bringing the God
Sivalinga&mdash;took it on their shoulders, and going off with it they
went to a He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>Then that man said [to the person inside the cage], &ldquo;After I
have placed it inside the shop, take the cash-box which is in it, and
put it inside the cage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la asked, &ldquo;What is that
cage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;Our deity, the God Sivalinga.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la asked, &ldquo;What is it, then, that
is necessary for offering to that deity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;The cooked rice from two quarts of raw rice,
and sweet plantains are wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la brought and gave him the cooked
rice from two quarts of raw rice, and ripe sweet plantains. After that,
the man gave to the man in the cage the cooked rice <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>from
a quart of the raw rice, and half the plantains. The other man ate the
rice from the other quart, and the remaining plantains.</p>
<p>In the evening the man gave the cage into the hands of the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257;, and told him to place it in the house. So the
He&#7789;&#7789;iy&#257; put the cage in the house. [During the night
the man inside it stole the cash-box.] When it got near midnight the
man asked for the cage, saying, &ldquo;He&#7789;&#7789;i-elder-brother,
give me my cage so that I may go.&rdquo; The He&#7789;&#7789;ir&#257;la
gave it.</p>
<p>As the man, taking the cage, was going along he met with a city.
Then that man said [to the man in the cage], &ldquo;After I have taken
this cage and placed it in the palace, you get the things in it and put
them inside the cage.&rdquo; Having said this they went to the palace.
The King asked, &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;Our deity, the God Sivalinga. We are able to
say sooth and the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King asked, &ldquo;What do you require for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;Rice cooked from raw rice, and sweet plantains
are necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the King gave him cooked rice and sweet plantains. The man having
given [a share of them] to the man in the cage, said, &ldquo;It is
necessary to place this cage inside the palace [for the
night].&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King having said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; he brought it, and
placed it inside the palace. As it was becoming light the man said,
&ldquo;Now then, I want the cage in order to worship the deity.&rdquo;
So the King gave him the cage.</p>
<p>Afterwards, as the man was taking the cage near a tank it became
light. He remained there until it was night, and then went to the house
of the man who went to seek Nikini, and found that the woman had called
in another man who was there. That man asked, &ldquo;What is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;This is our deity, the God Sivalinga. We are
able to tell sooth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It is good. There is a sooth that we,
too, require to ask about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the [pretended] Kapur&#257;la, whom the God Sivalinga
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>was [supposed to be] goading<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e7987src" href="#xd26e7987" name="xd26e7987src">3</a> to it,
became possessed. When he was saying sooth, the wife of the man who
went to seek Nikini and the false husband who had joined her, came with
their arms interlaced, and saying to the deity that a long time had
elapsed since her husband had gone in search of Nikini, they asked,
&ldquo;Has anything happened to him now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time the God Sivalinga said through the person possessed by
Sivalinga, &ldquo;The man has now become blind. Besides that, he will
not be permitted to return to his village. He will die while in that
state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then because he said this in the manner that was in the mind of the
woman, she took the food off the fire, and together with the false
husband brought the deity to her house, and gave the rice cooked from
two quarts of raw rice, and sweet plantains, in order that the
Kapur&#257;la might present an offering.</p>
<p>That night, when he had eaten, the Kapur&#257;la said, &ldquo;We
must place this our cage inside that [room].&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may do it,&rdquo; they said, and they placed it in the
house.</p>
<p>Then when the wife of the man who was inside the cage and the false
husband were spreading mats [to lie upon], and making ready for
sleeping, the Kapur&#257;la who remained outside said, &ldquo;Except
that [cage], there is no room for two.&rdquo; Thereupon the man who was
inside the cage came out, and beat the false husband even on the cheeks
with the cudgel that he had taken. So the man died.</p>
<p>After that, the man, as it was becoming light, went and threw the
Deer&rsquo;s elder sister into the river. Having returned, and gone to
the village with the Deer, the man who went for Nikini cooked for the
other man, and gave him to eat. Then the two divided the money, and he
gave the man the gem which he had, as a present for him, and sent that
man back to his village.</p>
<p>Afterwards this man, taking another wife, remained there. [According
to another version, however, he became a Buddhist monk.]</p>

<p>In a variant by a Tom-tom Beater of the North-western Province, a

King, and afterwards a R&#257;kshasa who was sent for the Nikini. At
the Boar&rsquo;s suggestion he died by jumping into a fire made by the
girl, and the Boar then followed his example, and was burnt up. The

<p class="first">At a certain city there are the King and the Queen, it
is said. They had one son, and while the Prince was living there the
Queen bore yet [another] Prince.</p>
<p>One day the two Princes having gone to the river to bathe, a
Princess from another city came to bathe [at the same place], and the
eldest Prince hid the robes of the Princess. Afterwards, on his
inviting the Princess she went with the Prince to his city.</p>
<p>After they had gone there, when the King got to know of it he said,
&ldquo;Should this rascal stay with me the kingdom will be
destroyed,&rdquo; and he ordered them to behead the Prince. Then the
Queen, the Prince&rsquo;s mother, having cooked a bundle of rice and
given it to him, said, &ldquo;Go away where you like [or the King will
behead you].&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince having taken the packet of cooked rice to the river, ate
it with the Princess. After eating it the two persons went to the house
of a widow woman. The Prince made the Princess stay with her, and
having given the Princess&rsquo;s robes into the hands of the widow
woman, said, &ldquo;Mother, put those robes into that box and this
box&rdquo; (that is, here and there, not all in one place, so that the
Princess should not be able to find them).</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the Prince had gone to the forge to get
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>a sword made, the Princess said to the widow
woman, &ldquo;Mother, give me my robes to look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow woman said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Daughter, I don&rsquo;t know
where they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Princess said, &ldquo;Why are you telling me lies? Give them to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On account of that, the widow woman opened the boxes, and gave the
robes to the Princess. The Princess took the robes, and saying,
&ldquo;Should he see me again it will be as [wonderful as] if he should
see the young of the Aet-Kanda L&#275;niy&#257;, or white where
charcoal has been rubbed,&rdquo; went away to the city of the
Princess.</p>
<p>When the Prince came after getting the sword made, he asked at the
hand of the widow woman, &ldquo;Where is the Princess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;On her asking for her robes I gave them.
Taking them, she said, &lsquo;Should he see me again it will be as
[wonderful as] if he should see the young of the Aet-Kanda
L&#275;niy&#257;, or white where charcoal has been rubbed&rsquo; [and
then she went away].&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince on that account rubbed and rubbed charcoal, and when he
looked there was a little white [colour]. Having seen it, he told the
widow woman to cook cakes. When they were cooked he took some and ate;
and tying up a cloth package of them, and taking it, and the sword, he
went off.</p>
<p>As he was passing through the middle of a forest, he saw a cobra
beginning to climb a tree in which were the little ones of the
Aet-Kanda L&#275;niy&#257;, and he cut it in two with the sword. While
he was climbing the tree after killing it, the little ones of the
Aet-Kanda L&#275;niy&#257; came to eat him. Then he said to the little
ones, &ldquo;O unrighteous ones! Why are ye coming to eat me? Look ye
on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Aet-Kanda little ones had looked on the ground, and seen
the cobra that he had cut in two, they said, &ldquo;[As you have saved
us from the cobra] we will render you any possible
assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Prince after going to the nest where they were, unfastened
the package of cakes, and having given to them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>also, ate. After eating, the little ones of the
Aet-Kanda L&#275;niy&#257; said, &ldquo;Mother will indeed eat you
to-day when she has come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Somehow or other you must save
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and made him creep among their
wings.</p>
<p>While he was there the Aet-Kanda L&#275;n&#299; (the female Rukh,
their mother), having pierced with its claws a tusk elephant, came
bringing it, after flying round the sea in three circles. After she had
come she said, &ldquo;What is this, children! Here is prey for you; are
you delaying to eat? On other days you come screaming for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those young ones said, &ldquo;Mother, to-day we are not hungry. Food
has been given to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>The little ones said, &ldquo;There is a man with us; [he gave it to
us].&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me him,&rdquo; the Aet-Kanda L&#275;n&#299; said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will eat him, mother,&rdquo; they replied.</p>
<p>The Aet-Kanda L&#275;n&#299; said, &ldquo;I will not eat
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so, take us and swear,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8087src" href="#xd26e8087" name="xd26e8087src">2</a> the little
ones said.</p>
<p>Then the Aet-Kanda L&#275;n&#299; swore, &ldquo;I will not eat
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the little ones showed the Aet-Kanda L&#275;n&#299; the
Prince. The Prince said to the Aet-Kanda L&#275;n&#299;, &ldquo;Look at
the foot of the tree; [I have saved your little ones by killing the
cobra].&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having looked, the Aet-Kanda L&#275;n&#299; said, &ldquo;I
will give you any possible assistance because you have done
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Prince having descended from the tree was unable to
cross the river. So the Aet-Kanda L&#275;n&#299; broke a stick, and
bringing it in her mouth told the Prince to hang from it. While the
Prince was hanging, the Aet-Kanda L&#275;n&#299; flew to the other side
of the river; after [leaving <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href=
"#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>him there] she returned to the
nest where the little ones were.</p>
<p>The Prince went on. As he was going along, some men were taking a
great many elephants. &ldquo;What are you taking those elephants
for?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Those men said, &ldquo;We are taking them to kill at the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I will give you these hundred masuran; let
them go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those men, saying &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; took the hundred masuran,
and let the elephants go.</p>
<p>After that, when he had gone much further still, he saw men taking a
great many pigs. The Prince asked, &ldquo;Where are you taking these
pigs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are taking them to kill at the city,&rdquo; the men
replied.</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I will give you these hundred masuran; let
them go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and taking the hundred masuran
let them go.</p>
<p>When the Prince had gone still a little further, men were taking a
great quantity of turtle-doves. &ldquo;Where are you taking those
turtle-doves?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are taking them to the city to kill,&rdquo; the men
replied.</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I will give you these hundred masuran; let
the turtle-doves go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and taking the hundred masuran
let them go.</p>
<p>When he had gone a little further still, men were taking a great
many fire-flies. &ldquo;Where are you taking them?&rdquo; the Prince
asked.</p>
<p>Those men replied, &ldquo;We are taking them to the city to
fry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;I will give you these hundred masuran; let
them go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and taking the hundred masuran
let them go.</p>
<p>When he had gone a little further yet, seven widow women came to the
well for water [which they said they wanted in order] to pour water on
the head of that Princess, who had become marriageable. A widow woman
said to that Prince, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295"
name="pb295">295</a>]</span>&ldquo;Take hold of this water-pot [and
help me to lift it up].&rdquo; Then the Prince having taken the
jewelled ring that was on his hand, put it in the water-pot
[unobserved]; after that he took hold of the water-pot [and helped her
to lift it].</p>
<p>When they had taken the water, and were pouring it on the head of
the Princess, the jewelled ring fell down. Having seen it [and
recognised it], the Princess ordered the woman to tell the Prince to
come. So the Prince went there.</p>
<p>After he had gone there [and told her that he had made a white mark
with charcoal, and had saved the lives of the little ones of the
Aet-Kanda L&#275;niy&#257;], that Princess said to the Prince,
&ldquo;[Before I will marry you, you must perform the tasks that I
shall give you. First you must] cut a chena suitable for sowing one and
a half amunas<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8142src" href="#xd26e8142"
name="xd26e8142src">3</a> of mun&#805;&rdquo; (a small pulse).</p>
<p>The Prince said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and having gone and cut a
branch or two at the chena, thought, &ldquo;An&#275;! Will the
elephants that I set free by giving a hundred masuran render an
assistance?&rdquo; Those elephants that he freed, having come at this
word, broke down all that jungle and went away.</p>
<p>After that, the Prince went to the Princess, and said, &ldquo;The
chena has been cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then set fire [to it],&rdquo; the Princess said. So the
Prince went and set fire [to the bushes]. The chena burnt excellently;
nothing remained, so well it burnt.</p>
<p>Having gone to the Princess he said, &ldquo;I set fire to the
chena.&rdquo; Then the Princess gave him one and a half amunas of
mun&#805;, and said, &ldquo;Sow this and come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Prince had gone he took the mun&#805; and sowed it at the
chena. Afterwards the Prince said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Will the pigs that
I set free by giving a hundred masuran render an assistance?&rdquo;
Then the pigs that he had freed by giving the hundred masuran all came
and dug [with their snouts] the whole of the chena.</p>
<p>The Prince went to the Princess, and said, &ldquo;I have sowed the
chena.&rdquo; After that, the Princess told him to collect and bring
back the mun&#805; that he had sown in the chena. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span></p>
<p>So the Prince having gone to the chena, and collected a little
mun&#805;, said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Will the turtle-doves that I freed by
giving a hundred masuran render an assistance?&rdquo; Then the
turtle-doves that he had set free having all come, picked up the
whole.</p>
<p>The Prince, collecting it and taking it to the city said to the
Princess, &ldquo;After collecting the mun&#805; that I sowed in the
chena I have come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then measure it,&rdquo; she said. When he was measuring it
there was one mun&#805; seed less. As she said this a turtle-dove
dropped it at the measuring place.</p>
<p>After that, the father of the Princess put that Princess and seven
widow women in a dark room. Having put them [there] the King said,
&ldquo;Unless you select and take out the Princess, or if you take out
any other person, I shall behead you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Prince had gone into the room [he thought], &ldquo;Will the
fire-flies that I freed by giving a hundred masuran render an
assistance?&rdquo; Then all the fire-flies having come, fastened on the
body of the Princess, as a lamp. After that, the Prince took the
Princess out into the light.</p>
<p>[As he had performed all the tasks, the Prince was married to the
Princess]. Afterwards the Prince, calling the Princess, went to the
house of that widow woman.</p>

<p class="first">In a variant of the first part of this story, a youth
whose father was dead, and whose mother, finding him in the way, wanted
to get rid of him in order to marry another man, was sent by his mother
to bring some milk, to be used medicinally for curing a pretended
illness of hers.</p>
<p>He was sent first to the Aet-Kanda Lihiniy&#257; (<i lang=
"si-latn">L&#275;niy&#257;</i> is an alternative spelling), and had the
same experiences at its nest, before he got the milk. The young birds
told their mother that he was their elder brother, the son of their

"noteref" id="xd26e8186src" href="#xd26e8186" name="xd26e8186src">4</a>
When he stated that he had come to ask for the milk, the Lihin&#299;
(the female Rukh) said, &ldquo;And&#333;! <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>Son, when did any one
get milk from me, and cure a sick person with it? She has done that to
kill you, not through want of it. However, since you have come I will
give you a little milk.&rdquo; One of the young birds accompanied him
to his home. After his mother had drunk the milk she pretended to be
still ill, and sent him for the milk of the Demon Hound,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e8191src" href="#xd26e8191" name="xd26e8191src">5</a>
which lived in a cave in a forest. I translate this part:&mdash;</p>
<p>The woman cooked and gave him a packet of rice. This youth, taking
the packet of cooked rice and his sword, and making the little one of
the Aet-Kanda Lihin&#299; stay at the house, went to the cave where the
Demon Hound was. When he arrived, the Demon Hound was not there; only
the little ones of the Demon Hound were there.</p>
<p>As the youth was going [to the cave] the little ones came growling
to eat him. When this youth unfastened the packet of cooked rice, and
showed them it, they stopped. Afterwards, the youth, having divided the
packet of cooked rice, gave [part] to the Demon Hound&rsquo;s little
ones, and taking some himself, they ate.</p>
<p>After they had eaten, the young dogs said, &ldquo;When mother has
come she will indeed eat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then this youth said, &ldquo;An&#275;! To-day you must somehow or
other save me. Do not let her eat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young dogs said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and putting the youth in
the hollow of the cave, the young dogs came to this side, [towards the
entrance], and remained there lying down.</p>
<p>While they were there the Demon Hound came. After she had come she
said, sniffing twice, &ldquo;Where does this smell of fresh human flesh
come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little ones of the Demon Hound replied, &ldquo;You eat fresh
human flesh, and you bring fresh human flesh; what is this that you are
saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Demon Hound said, &ldquo;No, children, a fresh human smell is
coming to me. Tell me [how it is]. Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little ones said, &ldquo;You will eat him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Demon Hound said, &ldquo;No, children, I will not eat him. Tell
me.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span></p>
<p>The little ones said, &ldquo;Take us and swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Demon Hound took her little ones and swore, &ldquo;I
will not eat him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the little ones showed her that youth, saying, &ldquo;Here he
is, mother; our little mother&rsquo;s son has come, our elder
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Demon Hound asked at the hand of this youth, &ldquo;What, son,
have you come for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This youth replied, &ldquo;Mother, our mother is ill. On account of
it she said, &lsquo;Should you go and bring a little milk, when I have
drunk it I shall become well.&rsquo; Because of that I have come to ask
for a little milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Demon Hound said, &ldquo;And&#333;! Son, when did a sick person
get milk from me and become well! To [get] you killed is the
explanation of that. However, since you have come, take a little milk
and go.&rdquo; So saying she gave him a little milk.</p>
<p>Afterwards, as this youth was preparing to set off with it, a young
dog said, &ldquo;I also want to go with our elder brother,&rdquo; and
howling [on account of it was allowed by his mother] to come away with
the youth.</p>
<p>Having arrived and given the milk to the woman, after she had drunk
it he asked, &ldquo;Now then, mother, is your illness cured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman said, &ldquo;And&#333;! Son, it is not cured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth asked, &ldquo;If so, what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman replied, &ldquo;Bring a little milk from the Bear that is
in the cave in the forest, and give me it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went for it, leaving the young Demon Hound at the house, and his
adventures and the conversations were a mere repetition of those at the
cave of the Demon Hound. One of the young Bears returned to the house
with him.</p>
<p>Lastly, he was sent to bring the milk of the Crocodile that was in
the Sea, &ldquo;the reservoir<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8245src" href=
"#xd26e8245" name="xd26e8245src">6</a> for the sky, and the reservoir
for the earth.&rdquo; He ate his rice on a mound in the sea, after
which, as he was descending into the sea, he observed a blue-lotus
flower, and found the Crocodile at it. It came to eat him, but he held
out his sword in front of him, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299"
href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>so it asked him why he had
come, and after hearing his explanation, in the very same words as
before, gave him a little milk. It warned him, like the other animals,
that the sending him for it was only a device to get him killed. He
took the milk home, and after drinking it his mother informed him that
she was cured. The story is then concluded as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Having said this, the woman went to the man [whom she wanted to
marry], and said, &ldquo;Now then, there is no means of killing that
one. From the places to which he went he has escaped and come back.
What, then, shall we do to that one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That man said, &ldquo;Cook to-day after it has become night. I will
break something in the lower part of the garden. Then say, &lsquo;Son.
There! Did you hear something break in the lower part of the garden?
Maybe cattle have come in.&rsquo; He will come to see, and when he has
come, I will chop him with the bill-hook, and kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, this woman having returned to the house, as she was
cooking when it became night, the man came and broke a stick in the
lower part of the garden. The woman said, &ldquo;And&#333;! Son, maybe
cattle have come in. Go quickly [and drive them out].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as this youth, having gone into the house and taken his sword,
was going out, that little one of the Aet-Kanda Lihin&#299;, and the
little one of the Demon Hound, and the little one of the Bear went with
him. The three of them having gone [in front] to the lower part of the
garden, bit the man who waited there, and having killed him returned.
When this youth went and looked, the man had been killed. Then the
youth came back, and having killed his mother stayed quietly there. So
that little one of the Aet-Kanda Lihin&#299;, and the little one of the
Demon Hound, and the young Bear, and the youth remained at the house
together.</p>

<p class="first">There are Indian versions of several of the incidents
of these stories. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300"
name="pb300">300</a>]</span></p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Old Deccan Days</i> (Frere), p. 15</span>,
a Prince killed a cobra that was about to ascend a tree in order to
destroy two eaglets. They assisted him afterwards.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i>
(Tawney), vol. i, p. 221</span>, the Garu&#7693;as or Rukhs are
described as being &ldquo;of the nature of vultures.&rdquo; A
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a got hid among the back feathers of one while it was
asleep, and was carried by it to the Golden City next day. These birds
are referred to (vol. i, p. 78) as breeding on a mountain called
Swar&#7751;am&#363;la, in Ceylon. Compare also the account of
Bh&#257;runda birds in <span class="bibl"><i>The
Kath&#257;ko&#347;a</i> (Tawney), p. 164</span>. According to Prof.
Sayce, the original idea of the Rukh is to be found in Z&#363;, the
storm-bird or god of the Sumerians (<span class="bibl"><i>The Religions
of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia</i>, p. 353</span>).</p>
<p>A lion-headed eagle with outspread wings, holding a lion by each of
its feet, formed the symbol of Lagash or Shirpurla, one of the earliest
Sumerian cities. It was the emblem of Ningirsu, the god of the city
(<span class="bibl"><i>A History of Sumer and Akkad</i>, by L. W. King,
1910, pp. 98, 100</span>). According to Mr. King&rsquo;s revised
chronology, this takes back the notion of this gigantic eagle, which
carried off and devoured the largest quadrupeds, to the fourth
millenium <span class="sc">B.C.</span> Its Sumerian name was
Imgig<span class="corr" id="xd26e8301" title="Source: ,">.</span></p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of Bengal</i> (Day), p.
134</span>, a Prince&rsquo;s wife, disguised as a Sanny&#257;si, or
Hindu religious mendicant, on her way to join her husband who was
ill&mdash;poisoned by lying on powdered glass that was spread over his
bed&mdash;rested under a tree in which a pair of Rukhs (in this story
called Bihangama and Bihangam&#299;) had their nest, containing two
young birds. She cut in two a snake that was about to climb the tree,
and that was accustomed to kill the young ones each year. She overheard
the conversation of the birds, which was to the effect that some of
their droppings would cure the Prince, if reduced to powder and applied
with a brush to the Prince&rsquo;s body, after bathing him seven times,
with seven jars of water and seven jars of milk. One of the birds
carried her on his back to the Prince, with the rapidity of lightning.
At p. 219, we learn that the dung of the young of this bird, when
applied fresh to the eyeballs, would cure blindness.</p>
<p>At pp. 189 and 192, a puppy and a young hawk joined a Prince on his
journey, but apparently owing to the omission of some incident of the
tale they were of no service to him. Such omissions are common; they
can only be supplied by collecting variants.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Wide-Awake Stories</i> (Steel and Temple),
pp. 74, 75</span>&mdash;<span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Punjab</i>,
pp. 66, 67</span>&mdash;a crow, peacock, and jackal in turn warned a
girl against a robber with whom she was going.</p>
<p>At p. 273&mdash;<span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Punjab</i>, p.
259</span>&mdash;Prince Ras&#257;lu was given the task of separating a
hundred-weight of millet seed from a hundred-weight of sand with which
it had been mixed. This was done for him by crickets in return for his
saving a cricket from a fire. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301"
href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the J&#257;taka story No. 444 (vol. iv, pp. 19, 20), a man laid
his hand on the head of a boy who had been bitten by a snake, and then
repeated a spell to restore him to health. The boy&rsquo;s father laid
his hand on the boy&rsquo;s breast while saying a second spell.</p>
<p>In the Tamil <span class="bibl"><i>Story of Madana K&#257;ma
R&#257;ja</i>, or &ldquo;Dravidian Nights&rdquo;
(Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), p. 21 ff.</span>, a Prince
purchased for a hundred pagodas apiece, a kitten and a snake, which he
reared for twelve years. They assisted him afterwards.</p>
<p>At p. 91 ff., a Prince was ordered by a King to bring snake&rsquo;s
poison, and afterwards whale&rsquo;s fat.</p>
<p>At p. 109 ff., a Prince who had four heavenly wives lost them
through his mother&rsquo;s returning to one of them her celestial
garment, which had been concealed. When in search of a way to his
wives, he saved an Ant-King, a Frog-King, and a Cricket-King. He went
to Indra, who gave him four tasks, of which one was that after an acre
of land had been sown with sesame seed and ploughed one hundred times,
he was to collect all the seeds. The Ant-King brought his subjects and
collected them for him. Another of the tasks, the last one, was the
selection of Indra&rsquo;s daughter, who was one of his wives, from the
four, who were all given the same appearance. The Cricket-King enabled
him to do this, by hopping onto her foot. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a certain city there are a man and a woman, it is
said. That woman was about to have a child. She cooked cakes to eat.
While she was eating, a crow came, and stayed there looking on.
&ldquo;She will throw me a piece of cake, at least,&rdquo; it thought.
The woman did not give it even a bit of the cakes.</p>
<p>Afterwards the crow went to the house of the R&#257;kshasa, and
breaking off a mango fruit came to that house, and ate it in front of
the woman who ate the cakes. While the crow was eating, the woman
thought, &ldquo;It will throw down a piece of it, at least.&rdquo; The
crow did not give her any of it; it ate the whole and flew away.</p>
<p>After the man of the house came, the woman said, &ldquo;The crow
brought a mango fruit, and turned it round and round, and ate the whole
of it. [Somehow or other you must get me a mango.]&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the man went to the house of the R&#257;kshasa, and
having ascended the mango tree, tried to pluck a mango fruit. As he was
plucking it the R&#257;kshasa came home. Seeing the man in the tree, he
asked, &ldquo;Who is that in the tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&#275;! I am in the tree,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you plucking mangoes for?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For our house-girl to eat. [She is about to have a child, and
has asked for one,]&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, pluck one and descend,&rdquo; the R&#257;kshasa
said.</p>
<p>So the man plucked one, and came down. After he had descended the
R&#257;kshasa said, &ldquo;Should she bear a son he is for thee; should
she bear a daughter, she is for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; and taking the mango fruit went
home. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span></p>
<p>News afterwards reached the R&#257;kshasa that she had borne a girl.
On account of it the R&#257;kshasa went to the house [and took the
girl]. As he was returning carrying the girl, he saw two boys going to
school, and said, &ldquo;Boys, boys, say a name for my
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys saying, &ldquo;Wimal&#299;, Wimal&#299;&rdquo; (pure or
beautiful one), ran away.</p>
<p>So the R&#257;kshasa took the girl to his house, and shared it with
her.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when he had gone to eat human flesh, the R&#257;kshasa
heard the sound of tom-toms saying, &ldquo;Wimali,&rdquo; [and thought
they were calling the girl]. So he came home, and asked Wimal&#299;,
&ldquo;Have you been out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have not been out. I have just got up,&rdquo;
Wimal&#299; said.</p>
<p>Next day he went again to eat human flesh. After he had gone he
heard the sound of tom-toms saying, &ldquo;Wimali.&rdquo; The
R&#257;kshasa came home, and asked Wimal&#299; again, &ldquo;Have you
been out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have just put on my cloth,&rdquo; Wimal&#299; said.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa having gone to eat human flesh on the following
day, again heard the sound of tom-toms saying, &ldquo;Wimali.&rdquo; He
came home and asked Wimal&#299;, &ldquo;Have you been out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have only just combed my hair,&rdquo; Wimal&#299;
said.</p>
<p>After that, news reached the King that a girl called Wimal&#299; was
at the R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s house. Having learnt this, the King came
to take away Wimal&#299;. When he arrived there [the R&#257;kshasa was
out, so] he formed a figure of Wimal&#299; out of rice flour, and after
placing that figure in the R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s house, took
Wimal&#299; to the city.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa came to the house and [finding that she was not
there] said, &ldquo;Wimal&#299; will not stay at home.&rdquo; Then he
tried to eat her figure, and ate a great part of the flour figure.
After he had eaten this [his mouth was choked with the flour, so] he
said, &ldquo;May a mouth be created on the top of my head.&rdquo; When
he had said this [the mouth was created, and] the R&#257;kshasa&rsquo;s
head being split in two by it, he died.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Pots of Oil</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A man having gone to the Lower Twelve Pattus (the name
of a district) to seek for coconuts, and having collected fifty or
sixty coconuts at a shed [where he was lodging, found that] because of
their great weight he was unable to bring them; and so he expressed
[the oil from] them.</p>
<p>Having expressed it, on the morning of the following day he asked
for two large pots, and filling them with the oil he tied them as a
pingo (carrying-stick) load (one below each end of the stick), and set
off with them.</p>
<p>During the time while he was coming on his way to his village, he
met a man in the road, and having given him betel, etc., to eat, said,
&ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, you must assist me a little. Take this pingo
load somewhat far, and hand it over to me. I will give you four
tuttu&rdquo; (three halfpence). [The man agreed to help him, and took
the load.]</p>
<p>Then the man, as he was going along the road, thought, &ldquo;With
the funds provided by these four tuttu I shall buy a hen chicken.
Having taken it home, after it has become large and laid twelve eggs I
shall [set them under it and] get twelve chickens. After the twelve
chickens have become big, I shall sell them for sixpence apiece. With
that money I shall get a he-goat and a she-goat, and that she-goat will
bear two kids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the kids have become large I can sell them for five
rupees apiece, and having given the ten rupees I shall get a buffalo
cow. While I am rearing the buffalo cow she will bear a calf. At that
time I shall go to ask about a lucky hour (fixed by astrology) for
taking the [first] milk. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href=
"#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;After I have got to know the lucky hour and gone to take the
milk, the buffalo cow, becoming afraid, will kick at me.&rdquo; Saying
this, he jumped aside in order to avoid it.</p>
<p>As he was coming on the path, at this time he had reached a
foot-bridge formed of a single tree trunk (<i lang=
"si-latn">&#275;dan&#7693;a</i>), and while going along at the middle
of it he made the jump [to escape the cow&rsquo;s kick]. As he jumped,
he fell off the tree trunk, taking the load of oil with him [and the
two pots were smashed].</p>
<p>At his fall, the owner of the oil asked, &ldquo;Having come so far
taking care of this oil, why did you throw it down and break the pots
at this foot-bridge, friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;With the funds provided by the four tuttu I
thought of buying a chicken. This happened owing to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the owner of the oil, saying, &ldquo;Never mind the
spilling of the oil; you must go with me,&rdquo; invited the man to
accompany him, and they went together. Having arrived at the village,
because he was a capable man [the owner of the oil] gave him his
daughter [in marriage].</p>
<p>Not a very long time afterwards, the men of the village said that
they must go to Puttalam to load salt and sun-dried fish, and bring
them back [bartering part of them on the way home]. The man said,
&ldquo;Father-in-law, I also must go to Puttalam.&rdquo; So the
father-in-law made ready a cart load of goods, and giving them to him
told him to go with the other men, and said, &ldquo;[When disposing of
the goods] the things which they count you also count and give; the
goods which they give &lsquo;simply&rsquo; (that is, without counting),
you also give &lsquo;simply.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8435src" href="#xd26e8435" name="xd26e8435src">1</a></p>
<p>Afterwards the men who went from the village, while coming back from
Puttalam, from place to place gave the goods they were bringing, and
took [in exchange] the things they wanted. The man having observed
which goods <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>they counted, counted and gave the same goods,
without [taking] money. The goods which the other men gave without
counting, that man also gave without counting. Thus, in that manner he
gave all the goods loaded into the cart, until at last only the cart
and the yoke of bulls remained over.</p>
<p>Afterwards the men who went in the party gave goods, and each one
got a horse. This man gave the cart and yoke of bulls and got a
horse.</p>
<p>While they were coming bringing the horses, the men of the party
gave goods, and each one got a goat of foreign breed. So this man gave
his horse, and got a goat.</p>
<p>While they were bringing the goats, the men of the party, saying,
&ldquo;We must each one get a dog with a party-coloured body,&rdquo;
gave goods, and got one apiece. So this man gave the foreign goat that
he was bringing, and got one.</p>
<p>Having come to a shop where they were selling foreign pots, the men
of the party gave goods, and each one got a foreign water-pot. This man
giving the parti-coloured dog, also got one.</p>
<p>Afterwards having come very close to their village, each of the men
of the party, saying, &ldquo;I will give four tuttu and get
shaved,&rdquo; got shaved. So this man gave that foreign water-pot, and
got himself shaved.</p>
<p>In the end the man returned home without either cart, or yoke of
bulls, or goods.</p>

was going in search of work gathered some leaves on the road-side,
which are eaten as a vegetable. In another district where there were no
vegetables he exchanged them for fishes, a leaf for a fish. Going on,
he bartered these for digging hoes, and these again for oxen, with

would become a rich man. He would get married and have numerous
children, who would be well educated and well dressed. His wife would
become inattentive to her duties at the house. During her absence the
children would run about near the cows, and the youngest one would be
injured by them. For neglecting them he would beat his wife, and taking
up his stick to beat her he smashed the pots containing his provisions.

<p class="first">There are a King and a Queen of a certain city, and
there is a daughter of the Queen.</p>
<p>They asked [permission] to summon the daughter to go [in marriage]
to the Prince of another city. The King said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; so
they came from that city to summon the King&rsquo;s Princess. After
coming, they told the bride to come out [of her chamber] in order to
eat the rice [of the wedding-feast]. The Queen said, &ldquo;She is
eating cooked rice in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they told her to come out in order to dress her in the robes
[sent by the bridegroom (?)]. The Queen said, &ldquo;She is putting on
robes [in her chamber].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they told her to come out in order to go [to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s city]. So the Queen told two persons to come, and
having put a female Mouseling<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n308.1">1</a> in an incense box, brought it, and gave it into the
hands of the two persons, and said, &ldquo;Take ye this, and until
seven days have gone by do not open the mouth of the box.&rdquo; Having
taken it to the city, when they opened the mouth of the box after seven
days, a mouse sprang out, [and hid itself] among the cooking pots.</p>
<p>There was also a (servant) girl at the Prince&rsquo;s house. The
girl apportioned and gave cooked rice and vegetable [curry] to the
Prince, and covered up the cooking pots [containing the rest of the
food]. Then the Mouseling came, and having taken and eaten some of the
cooked rice and vegetables, covered up the cooking pots, and went again
among the pots.</p>
<p>On the following day the same thing occurred. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>Prince said to the girl. &ldquo;Does the
Mouseling eat the cooked rice? Look and come back.&rdquo; The girl
having gone and looked, came back and said, &ldquo;She has eaten the
cooked rice, and covered the cooking pots, and has gone.&rdquo; The
Prince said, &ldquo;Go thou also, and eat rice, and come back.&rdquo;
So the girl went and ate rice, and returned.</p>
<p>Next day the Prince said, &ldquo;I am going to cut paddy (growing
rice). Remain thou at the house, and in the evening place the articles
for cooking near the hearth.&rdquo; Then the Prince went. Afterwards,
in the evening the girl placed the things for cooking near the hearth,
and went out of the way.</p>
<p>The Mouseling came, and cooked and placed [the food ready], and
again went behind the pots. After evening had come, that girl
apportioned and gave the rice to the Prince. The Prince ate, and told
the girl, &ldquo;Go thou also, and eat rice, and come back.&rdquo; So
the girl went and ate rice, and having covered the cooking pots came to
the place where the Prince was.</p>
<p>Then the Mouseling came and ate rice, and covered up the pots. After
that, she said to the [other] mice, &ldquo;Let us go and cut the
paddy,&rdquo; and collecting a great number of mice, cut all the paddy,
and again returned to the house, and stayed among the pots. Next day
when the Prince went to the rice field to cut the paddy, all had been
cut.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Prince came back, and saying, &ldquo;Let us go and
collect and stack [the paddy],&rdquo; collected the men, and stacked
it, and threshed it by trampling [it with buffaloes]. Then they went
and called the women, and having got rid of the chaff in the wind,
brought the paddy home.</p>
<p>After they had brought it, the Prince went near the place where the
cooking pots were stored, at which the Mouseling was hidden, and said,
&ldquo;Having pounded this paddy [to remove the husk], and cooked rice,
let us go to your village [to present it to your parents, as the
first-fruits].&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mouseling said, &ldquo;I will not. You go.&rdquo; So the Prince
told the girl to pound the paddy and cook rice, and having done this
she gave it to the Prince. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href=
"#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Prince took the package of cooked rice, and went to the
Mouseling&rsquo;s village, and gave it to the Mouseling&rsquo;s
mother.</p>
<p>The Queen asked at the hand of the Prince, &ldquo;Where is the
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince said, &ldquo;She refused to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queen said, &ldquo;Go back to the city, and having placed the
articles for cooking near the hearth, get hid, and stay in the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Prince returned to the city, he did as she had told him.
The Mouseling having come out, took off her mouse-jacket, and [assuming
her shape as a girl] put on other clothes. While she was preparing to
cook, the Prince took the mouse-jacket, and burnt it.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the girl went to the place where the mouse-jacket
had been, and looked for it, it was not there. Then she looked in the
hearth, and saw that there was one sleeve in it. While she was there
weeping and weeping, the Prince [came forward and] said, &ldquo;Your
mother told me to burn the mouse-jacket.&rdquo; So the Mouseling became
the Princess again, and the Prince and Princess remained there.</p>

<p class="first">The notion of a skin dress that could be put off and
on, and that transformed a person into one of the lower animals, is
well-known in folk-tales. It is found in <span class="bibl"><i>Old
Deccan Days</i> (Frere), pp. 183, 193</span>, where a King had a
jackal-skin coat which turned him into a jackal when he put it on,
until it was burnt.</p>
<p>At p. 222, a Princess concealed herself by putting on the skin of an
old beggar woman. She was discovered when she removed it in order to
wash it and herself. In the end it was burnt by the Prince she had
married, and she retained her true form as a Princess.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Fairy Tales</i> (Stokes), p. 41
ff.</span>, there is a Prince who had a monkey skin, which he could put
on and off as he wished.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i>,
Panj&#257;b (Swynnerton), p. 344</span>, four fairies came in the form
of doves, and took off their feather dresses in order to bathe. A
Prince concealed one dress, and the fairy was unable to resume her bird
form and fly away.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Story of Madana K&#257;ma
R&#257;ja</i>, or &ldquo;Dravidian Nights&rdquo;
(Na&#7789;&#275;&#347;a S&#257;str&#299;), pp. 56, 57</span>, there is
an account of a tortoise Prince who had the power of leaving his shell
and assuming his human <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href=

transformation, and smashed the shell, after which he remained a
Prince.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Folk-Tales of Hindustan</i>, Allahabad
(Shaik Chilli), p. 54 ff.</span>, the daughter of the King of the
P&#275;ris had the form of a monkey while she wore a monkey&rsquo;s
skin, and her own form at other times. When a Prince burnt the skin she
took fire, and flew away in a blaze to her father&rsquo;s palace. While
she was ill there, the Prince discovered her and cured her, and she did
not resume her monkey form.</p>
<p>The feather-vest of the Dove-maidens&mdash;female Jinn&mdash;in the

<h2 class="main">S&#299;giris Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333;, the Giant</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a country there was a great person called
S&#299;giris Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333;. He was a very wealthy person;
under him ten hired labourers worked.</p>
<p>During the time while he was in this state, S&#299;giris
Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333; having thought he would drink arrack (spirit
distilled from palm juice), began to drink a very little. In that way
he became accustomed to drink very largely. Afterwards having come
[home] drunk he went to beat the labourers; also he did not give them
their wages properly. When he had acted in this manner for many days,
they, after speaking together, gave S&#299;giris
Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333; a good beating, and on account of their
[short] pay took the goods of S&#299;giris Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333;,
and went away. Then no one would give work to S&#299;giris
Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333;, so he drank until the goods in his house were
finished.</p>
<p>Then, there being nothing for this one to drink or eat, and having
become like a madman, at the time when he was walking and walking about
he saw a man carrying a young coconut. Begging, &ldquo;Give me
that,&rdquo; and taking it, he went to a travellers&rsquo;
resting-shed.</p>
<p>While he was there eating the young coconut after breaking it, a
great number of flies began to settle there. After he had struck at the
flies with his hand, twenty died. Thereupon this one went to a person
who did tin work, and said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, do a little work
for me and give me it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the tin worker asked.</p>
<p>This one said, &ldquo;Cut on a sheet of tin in Tamil and Sinhalese,
&lsquo;I killed twenty,&rsquo; and give me it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; he cut it and gave it.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span></p>
<p>After he had cut and given it, this one took it, and preparing a
hanging board, and hanging the sheet of tin on it, put the cord on his
neck, and walked along the roads. Men who saw this stepped on one side
through fear, and went away.</p>
<p>Certain Tamils having seen this at a city, said to S&#299;giris
Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333;, &ldquo;In our country the King has a giant.
Should any one fight with him and win, the King said he will give him a
present of five hundred masuran, and the post of Prime Minister. This
being so, can you go there with us [and fight him],&rdquo; they
asked.</p>
<p>Then S&#299;giris Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333;, thinking, &ldquo;Let me
go even should I be struck by lightning,&rdquo; said, &ldquo;I am able
to fight with the giant,&rdquo; and went to that city with the
Tamils.</p>
<p>Having arrived there, these Tamils handed him over to the King under
whom that giant had a post. The King asked this one, &ldquo;I have a
giant. Canst thou fight with the giant and win?<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e8626" title="Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>S&#299;giris Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333; said instantly, &ldquo;A son
who has killed twenty giants better than that one am I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the King said to his giant, &ldquo;Now then, do what fighting
thou knowest, and conquer that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the giant said to S&#299;giris Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333;,
&ldquo;To-day you must come and swim [against me] in the great sea for
eight days. We require from the King ten rupees in order to get things
to eat while we are swimming.&rdquo; Having said this and got them, the
two giants went to the shops, and got things for the ten rupees.</p>
<p>Then S&#299;giris the Giant said to that giant, &ldquo;What are
these few things! For one meal I want six quarts of rice and I want
three bottles of arrack. I can swim for eight or ten months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, this giant thought, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat as much as
this one, and I can&rsquo;t drink as much, and I can&rsquo;t swim for
eight or ten months. Therefore I am indeed unable to swim with this
giant and beat him.&rdquo; He told the King so.</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;If so, thou wilt lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The giant said, &ldquo;At swimming I shall lose. We must fight each
other.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; said the King. Then the King asked
S&#299;giris Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333;, &ldquo;Canst thou fight with
this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>S&#299;giris Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333; replied, &ldquo;I will give
that one one blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the King said, &ldquo;Fight ye each other to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon S&#299;giris the Giant said, &ldquo;Not to-morrow. After a
month has gone both giants will fight each other. Having proclaimed it,
and put both of us into two houses under one roof, you must give us to
eat until the month is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;It is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>S&#299;giris the Giant having sought for an iron nail, from that day
dug into the wall of the house in which the giant was [which separated
their two rooms]. Having dug [nearly through] it, when the month would
be finished to-morrow S&#299;giris the Giant said to that giant,
&ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Giant, give me a little tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That giant said, &ldquo;How can I give you tobacco there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>S&#299;giris the Giant replied, &ldquo;Knock a hole through that
wall with your hand, and give me it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; that one said.</p>
<p>Then S&#299;giris the Giant said, &ldquo;What sort of a giant art
thou, one who can&rsquo;t make a hole through that wall and give me a
little tobacco!&rdquo; Saying, &ldquo;Look there! Give me it through
there,&rdquo; S&#299;giris the Giant struck with his hand at the place
which he had previously bored. When he struck it his hand made a hole
through to the other side. That giant becoming afraid at the blow,
began to tremble, and thought, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t win in fighting
with this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following day they made them come out to fight. The place was
filled with people who had come to look on. S&#299;giris the Giant
thinks in his mind, &ldquo;To-day is indeed my Fate. How shall I
escape?&rdquo; That giant, through fear his thoughts were the same.</p>
<p>The King said, &ldquo;Strike ye each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; each one being afraid of the
other, said, &ldquo;Strike thou.&rdquo; S&#299;giris says to the other,
&ldquo;Thou strike,&rdquo; he says. By that one and by this one not a
blow was struck.</p>
<p>Then the King says to S&#299;giris the Giant, &ldquo;Strike thou
first.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=

<p>S&#299;giris the Giant said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and thinking
of running away, and saying to the people, addressing them loudly,
&ldquo;Get to both sides, and stop there,&rdquo; looked round to run
off. At that, the other giant, rolling the people over, began to run
away, and the people who were there cried &ldquo;H&#363;,&rdquo; after
him.</p>
<p>Then the King having become pleased with S&#299;giris
Si&ntilde;&ntilde;&#333;, and having given him a present of five
hundred masuran, established him in the post of Prime Minister.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the midst of a certain forest a Lion stayed. Having
joined with that very Lion, a Jackal was eating and eating the flesh of
animals killed by the Lion.</p>
<p>After a few days had gone by, the Jackal, becoming arrogant, said to
the Lion, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;Jackal&rsquo; to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, &ldquo;What shall I say?&rdquo; the Lion asked.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal says, &ldquo;You must call me, saying to me,
&lsquo;Jackal-artificer&rsquo; (<i lang="si-latn">Nari
nayid&#275;</i>).&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this way, when the Lion had said, &ldquo;Jackal-artificer,&rdquo;
for many days, he said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say
&lsquo;Jackal-artificer.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What name am I to say?&rdquo; the Lion asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say to me, &lsquo;Small Lion&rsquo;; don&rsquo;t say,
&lsquo;Jackal-artificer,&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After the Lion had been saying, &ldquo;Small Lion,&rdquo; for a few
days, &ldquo;Say to me, &lsquo;Great Lion&rsquo;; don&rsquo;t say,
&lsquo;Small Lion,&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; he said to the Lion.</p>
<p>Then the Lion says, &ldquo;For me to say, &lsquo;Great Lion,&rsquo;
you must make the Lion&rsquo;s roar,&rdquo; the Lion said.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal having gone near a tusk elephant, after he had cried
out, as the Lion&rsquo;s roar, &ldquo;Hokkiy&#275;, Hokkiy&#275;&rdquo;
(the beginning of the customary yelping cry of the Jackal), the
tusk-elephant kicked the Jackal.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Jackal died.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Seven Robbers</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a country there are seven robbers. Among them, in
the same gang, there is a fool. One day they went to commit robbery.
While they were there, they got a devil-dancer&rsquo;s box, containing
his mask and ornaments. Having brought it, the seven persons went into
a rock cave to sleep.</p>
<p>When they had gone there that foolish man became hungry. After the
others went to sleep that fool took out the devil-dancer&rsquo;s
clothes, and having looked at them put them on.</p>
<p>After he had put them on, one of those men opened his eyes. Then on
account of the noise of the bells [of the devil-dancer] the others
opened their eyes also. When they saw the man dressed in the
devil-dancer&rsquo;s clothes they were frightened, and saying,
&ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! The Kohomba deity is coming,&rdquo; the other
six persons ran away.</p>
<p>As they were running, that man who had the clothes ran after them,
saying, &ldquo;Stay there, stay there.&rdquo; While they were running
those six persons leaped over a well [in the path]. This one also
jumped, but being held back by the clothes he fell into the mouth of
the well.</p>
<p>After he had fallen into the well, a woman came to draw water. Then
he placed his weight in the bucket when she lowered it. After the woman
had got to know of the weight, striving and striving she got the bucket
near the mouth of the well. The man who had fallen, and was in it,
said, &ldquo;A little more, my mother.&rdquo; Then the woman hearing
this [and seeing what she thought was a demon in the well], let go, and
bounded away.</p>

is a variant of this tale. Some robbers whom one of them was assisting
left him outside a house with a basket that he had brought out of it.
While they were inside searching for booty, he found in the basket the
dress worn in representations of a demon termed Gar&#257; Yak&#257;,
and put it on. When the robbers came out they thought he was the demon
himself, and ran off, with the idiot at their heels. In the end, they
jumped into a well, were followed by him, and all were drowned.

<h2 class="main">The Stupid Boy</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city there are a Gamar&#257;la, a
Gama-g&#257;&#275;ni (his wife), and a son of theirs. The Gamar&#257;la
went to the chena. The Gama-g&#257;&#275;ni lay down, and told the
Gama-puta (the son) to examine her head [for insects]. While he was
looking through the hair she fell asleep, and a fly settled on her
head. &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Fly, do not bite our mother&rsquo;s
head,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;mother will scold me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fly having gone flying away, settled again on her head. Saying,
&ldquo;Now then, this fly is biting mother&rsquo;s head again,&rdquo;
he placed his mother&rsquo;s head gently on the ground. Then having
gone and taken a rice pestle, and come back with it, he said, &ldquo;Is
the fly still biting the head?&rdquo; and struck at the fly with the
rice pestle, killing his mother with the blow.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s father having come, tried to arouse her. &ldquo;How
is it that mother is dead?&rdquo; he asked. The boy said, &ldquo;A fly
was biting our mother&rsquo;s head. I struck it with the rice pestle.
Because of it she died.&rdquo; So the Gamar&#257;la took the woman away
and buried her.</p>
<p>Then he came home with the boy. Having arrived, the Gamar&#257;la
told the boy to make a pot of gruel. Having made the pot of gruel he
told the boy to take it, and they went to the jungle to cut fence
sticks. The man, cutting and cutting the fence sticks, told the boy to
draw them out, and throw them down. Then the boy, taking the fence
sticks, threw them into the river.</p>
<p>Taking the pot of gruel, and making a raised platform of sticks, he
placed it on it. The Gamar&#257;la said to the boy, &ldquo;Now then, as
you have come here, go and drink <span class="corr" id="xd26e8794"
title="Source: greul">gruel</span>.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>Then
the boy having gone under the stick frame, and pierced the bottom of
the pot, and made a hole through it, placed his mouth under it, and
drank a sufficient quantity. Still the gruel comes from the pot, so the
boy said to the pot of gruel, &ldquo;Father is there. Don&rsquo;t come
out, gruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having cut the fence sticks, the Gamar&#257;la came to drink gruel.
There was nothing in the gruel pot. He asked at the hand of the boy,
&ldquo;Where, A&#7693;&#257;! is the gruel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gruel went out while I was saying don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la thought, &ldquo;There is no need to keep this
boy,&rdquo; and having beaten him he drove him away.</p>
<p>As the boy was going, weeping and weeping, he met with a Buddhist
monk.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8807src" href="#xd26e8807" name=
"xd26e8807src">1</a> There were two bundles in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.
He told the boy to take the couple of bundles. As the boy was carrying
them he asked at the hand of the Lord, &ldquo;What is there in the
bundles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Palm-sugar packets,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8821src" href=
"#xd26e8821" name="xd26e8821src">2</a> and plantains,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The Lord asked at the hand of the boy, &ldquo;What is thy
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy said, &ldquo;My name is Aewariyakk&#257;
Mulakk&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was coming along from there the boy lagged behind. So the monk
spoke to the boy, &ldquo;Aewariyakk&#257; Mulakk&#257;, A&#7693;&#257;!
Come on quickly,&rdquo; he said. Then the boy ate some packets of
sugar,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8831src" href="#xd26e8831" name=
"xd26e8831src">3</a> and rows of plantains.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8835src" href="#xd26e8835" name="xd26e8835src">4</a></p>
<p>The monk having gone to the pansala (monk&rsquo;s residence), when
he looked [found that] packets of sugar and rows of plantains were
missing. &ldquo;A&#7693;&#257;! where are the other plantains and
palm-sugar that were in these?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, I am a packet eater (Mulakk&#257;), and a
first-row-of-plantains eater (Aewariyakk&#257;),&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I ate them.&rdquo; There and then, having beaten the boy, he
chased him away.</p>
<p>Then, as a washerwoman-aunt was washing clothes, she saw the boy
going along, and asked him, &ldquo;Can you live at our house?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; he said. She asked his name; Giy&#257; (&ldquo;He
went&rdquo;) he said was his name. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321"
href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having taken the washed clothes, and placed them in the house, he
asked at the hand of the mother for the [unwashed] clothes that were in
the house. She told him to come [and take them]. After the boy had come
in, the mother asked at the hand of the boy, &ldquo;What is your
name?&rdquo; The boy said, &#256;w&#333; (&ldquo;He came&rdquo;), and
took the clothes away.</p>
<p>Afterwards, because both the clothes and the boy were missing, [the
washer-woman] having searched and looked for him, went home. On account
of her going late the washerman called her [and asked the reason]. She
said, &ldquo;It is because of Giy&#257;&rdquo; (the words might also
mean, &ldquo;It is because he went&rdquo;). A man who was in the house
having heard it, said, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#257;! He said
&#256;w&#333;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While both were saying, &ldquo;Giy&#257;,&rdquo;
&ldquo;&#256;w&#333;,&rdquo; (&ldquo;He went, he came&rdquo;), the boy
took the clothes, and went to his village.</p>

<p class="first">The fly-killing incident occurs in <span class=
"bibl"><i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i> (Swynnerton), p.
306</span>, in which a Buneyr man killed an old woman by throwing a
stone at a fly that was on her face.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl">J&#257;taka story No. 44 (vol. i, p.
116)</span>, a boy killed his father by striking with an axe at a
mosquito that had settled on his pate, splitting his head at the blow.
In the next J&#257;taka tale, a girl killed her mother by aiming a blow
with a pestle at the flies that had settled on her head when she was
lying down.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. i, p. 284</span>,
there is a Kashm&#299;r story by the Rev. J. H. Knowles, in which a
bear who had become friendly with a man, killed him by throwing a piece

<h2 class="main">The Gamar&#257;la and the Washerman</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there are a Gamar&#257;la and a
Washerman.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8897src" href="#xd26e8897" name=
"xd26e8897src">1</a> Those two persons cut a chena. As they were
cutting the chena a jungle-cock crowed. The Gamar&#257;la said to the
Washerman, &ldquo;Please catch that crowing jungle-cock, and come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Washerman said, &ldquo;Will you do the chena work until I
catch the jungle-cock and come back?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until you come I will do the chena work,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>From there that man came home, and remained there. When the chena
[crop] was ripening he caught the jungle-cock, and went back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not give thee a share of the chena,&rdquo; the
Gamar&#257;la said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Washerman instituted a lawsuit against him.</p>
<p>When they were going for it on the day of the trial, he borrowed a
cloth from the Gamar&#257;la, and went after putting it on. When the
action was being heard the Washerman said, &ldquo;He will say next that
this cloth is that gentleman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;It is so indeed. If not, Bola,
whose is that cloth?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The Washerman said, &ldquo;There! I said so. O Lord, when coming on
account of this day of the trial, was it necessary for me to ask for a
cloth from that gentleman? Am I without clothes to that
extent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the judge told them to divide the chena in two, [and
each take half of it]. Afterwards, having come there they divided it in
two. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p>Again, this Washerman and the Gamar&#257;la sowed a paddy field
(rice field). Of the paddy plants in the field, those things that were
above the ground were for the Washerman, they said. Those which were
below the ground were for the Gamar&#257;la, they said. Having cut the
paddy when the crop ripened, they threshed it by trampling [with
cattle], and the Washerman took the paddy. Afterwards they cut the
ground; there was nothing for the Gamar&#257;la.</p>
<p>Again, these two persons planted onions. This time, those things
that were above the ground were for the Gamar&#257;la, they said. Those
that were below the ground were for the Washerman, they said. When the
crop was ready, the Gamar&#257;la having cut off the onion stumps,
heaps them up together; the Washerman dug up and got the onions.</p>
<p>After that, those two persons got a buffalo bull. The front part of
that bull was for the Washerman, they said; the after part for the
Gamar&#257;la, they said.</p>
<p>Next, the two persons got a buffalo cow. The front part was for the
Gamar&#257;la; the after part for the Washerman, they said. Thereupon
the calves which the buffalo cow bore belonged to the Washerman, he
said. When the Gamar&#257;la asked for calves because the front part
did not give birth to calves, &ldquo;There is nothing for you,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>After that, the Gamar&#257;la, in order to build a house, cut
Waewarana, Kae&#7789;ak&#257;la, M&#299;lla, Kolon trees (good timber
trees commonly used in building houses). The Washerman, also, saying,
&ldquo;I also must build a house,&rdquo; cut Paepol, Eramudu,
Murung&#257; trees (all of which are soft woods, quite useless for any
kind of work).</p>
<p>When the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s wife was coming near his house, the
Washerman, taking the Naekat Pota (an astrological book which deals
with prognostications), read aloud from it [these sham prognostications
regarding the results to the occupiers if these woods be used in house
building]: &ldquo;For a house of Waewarana, diarrhoea; for a house of
Kae&#7789;ak&#257;la, quarrel; for a house of M&#299;lla, hanging; for
a house of Eramudu, purity; for a house of Paepol, land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s wife having heard this, goes and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>says to the Gamar&#257;la, &ldquo;You have done
a foolish thing again. We shall have only sickness and trouble if we
build the house with those trees. In the Naekat Pota it is so written.
If we use the trees that the Washerman has cut we shall be
fortunate.&rdquo; So the Gamar&#257;la went to the Washerman, and
persuaded him to exchange trees with him. Then the Washerman built
himself a good house with the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s trees. The trees
which the Gamar&#257;la got were of no use to him.</p>

<p class="first">This devil having arrived at the place, addressed a
husbandman and asked him what he did. The poor man replied to him that
he sowed that field of early wheat to assist him in living during the
following year. &ldquo;But really,&rdquo; said the devil, &ldquo;this
field is not thine; it is mine and belongs to me &hellip;; however, I
leave thee the field. But it is on condition we shall share the
profit.&rdquo; &ldquo;I agree to it,&rdquo; replied the husbandman.
&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said the devil, &ldquo;that of the coming profit
we shall make two shares. The one shall be what grows above the ground,
the other what shall be covered in the earth. The choice belongs to me,
for I am a devil of a noble and ancient race; thou art only a villein.
I choose that which will be in the ground, thou shalt have that above.
When will the reaping be?&rdquo; &ldquo;In the middle of July,&rdquo;
replied the husbandman. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the devil, &ldquo;I
need not be present here. In other respects do thy duty. Work, villein,
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The middle of July having come, the devil presents himself again at
the place, accompanied by a squadron of little chorister devilets.
Meeting there the husbandman, he said to him, &ldquo;And now, villein,
how hast thou been since my departure? It is requisite to make our
division now?&rdquo; &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; replied the
husbandman.</p>
<p>Then the husbandman, with his people, began to reap the corn. The
little devils similarly drew the stubble from the ground. The
husbandman threshed his corn in the air, put it in sacks, and carried
it to the market to sell. The devilets did the same, and at the market
seated themselves near the husbandman to sell their stubble.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>The husbandman sold his corn very well, and with
the money filled an old sock which he carried at his belt. The devils
sold nothing, but on the contrary the peasants jeered at them in the
midst of the market.</p>
<p>The market being over, said the devil to the husbandman,
&ldquo;Villein, thou hast cheated me this time; at another thou shalt
not deceive me.&rdquo; &ldquo;My Lord Devil,&rdquo; replied the
husbandman, &ldquo;how have I cheated you who have chosen first? True
it is that in that choice you thought of cheating me, hoping that
nothing would come out of the ground as my share, and to find, below,
the whole of the corn that I had sown&#8202;&hellip;. But you are very
young at the trade.&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;Leave this discourse,&rdquo;
said the devil; &ldquo;with what canst thou sow our field this
following year?&rdquo; &ldquo;For profit,&rdquo; replied the
husbandman, &ldquo;and good economy it is expedient to sow
radishes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said the devil, &ldquo;thou
art an honest man; sow plenty of radishes. I shall protect them from
tempests, and shall not hail at all on them. But, understand
thoroughly, I keep as my share what shall be above ground; thou shalt
have what is below. Work, villein, work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time for the reaping having come, the devil was present at the
spot with a squadron of household devilets. There, meeting the
husbandman and his people, he began to reap and collect the leaves of
the radishes. After him the husbandman dug and drew out the large
radishes, and put them into sacks. So they went all together to the
market. The husbandman sold his radishes very well. The devil sold
nothing. What was worse, they jeered at him publicly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see well, villain,&rdquo; the devil then said, &ldquo;that
I am cheated by thee. I want to make an end of the field between thee
and me.&rdquo;</p>

Washerman.</span> (Variant.)</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there is a Gamar&#257;la, it is
said. A Washerman, having come there, became friendly with the
Gamar&#257;la. Having become friendly, he takes charge of the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s cattle for grazing. During the time while he was
grazing them the two persons chop chenas and do rice field work.</p>
<p>Well then, the two persons having become very thoroughly friends, at
the time while they were thus, the cattle grazed by the Washerman
increased by a buffalo bull and a buffalo <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb326" href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>cow. Afterwards, the
Washerman having come [to the other man] said, &ldquo;Now then,
Gamar&#257;hami,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8984src" href="#xd26e8984"
name="xd26e8984src">2</a> we must divide the two cattle between
us.&rdquo; The Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;H&#257;. Let us divide
them.&rdquo; Afterwards the Washerman having gone and caught the two
cattle, tied them up.</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la went there. Then the Washerman said, &ldquo;Now
then, the Gamar&#257;hami indeed has cattle. I myself have no cattle.
Because of it, let the after portion of this buffalo cow be for me. The
front portion the Gamar&#257;hami will be good enough to take.&rdquo;
The Gamar&#257;la, having consented to that, said, &ldquo;H&#257;. It
is good.&rdquo; Well then, in complete agreement they shared the
buffalo cow.</p>
<p>Again, to share the buffalo bull the Washerman said,
&ldquo;Gamar&#257;hami, let the front side of the buffalo bull be for
me, the after side the Gamar&#257;hami will be good enough to
take.&rdquo; Well then, the Gamar&#257;la having consented to that
also, by the agreement of the two persons they divided the buffalo bull
also.</p>
<p>During the time while they were thus, the Washerman having taken the
buffalo bull ploughs for himself. The Gamar&#257;la also one day was
going to take the buffalo bull to plough. Then the Washerman quarrelled
with him: &ldquo;The front part belongs to me; the after part belongs
to you. I will not allow you to plough with my side,&rdquo; he
said.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9005src" href="#xd26e9005" name=
"xd26e9005src">3</a> The Gamar&#257;la having become angry came
home.</p>
<p>The buffalo cow having gone to the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house eats
by stealth. Men having come told the Gamar&#257;la,
&ldquo;Gamar&#257;la, your buffalo cow comes to our rice field [and
eats the crop]. On that account attend well to its grazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me. Tell that
to the Washerman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the men having gone, told the Washerman, &ldquo;Washerman, the
buffalo cow that you are causing to graze eats by stealth [in our rice
field]. Attend well to its grazing.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Washerman said, &ldquo;What are you telling me? Doesn&rsquo;t
the front half belong to the Gamar&#257;hami? Isn&rsquo;t it the
Gamar&#257;hami who must attend to the grazing?&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e9017src" href="#xd26e9017" name=
"xd26e9017src">4</a></p>
<p>The Washerman having come to the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house,
quarrelled with the Gamar&#257;la [over it]. The Gamar&#257;la became
very angry.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Gamar&#257;la went to institute a lawsuit against
the Washerman [on account of these matters]. That day, having entered
the suit, and having come back to the village, he went to the Washerman
to tell him the day of the trial. Having told him, the Gamar&#257;la
came home.</p>
<p>On the following day, the Washerman came to the Gamar&#257;la.
Afterwards, the Gamar&#257;la having given the Washerman to eat and
drink, and having made ready to go for the day of the trial, the
Washerman said, &ldquo;Gamar&#257;hami, I have no [suitable] cloth to
wear when going.&rdquo; The Gamar&#257;la gave (that is, lent) him a
cloth. The Washerman putting on the cloth, both of them went for the
trial-day.</p>
<p>After they went, the assessors<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9029src"
href="#xd26e9029" name="xd26e9029src">5</a> having assembled heard the
lawsuit. When they asked the Gamar&#257;la [regarding the matter], the
Gamar&#257;la said, &ldquo;The after portion of the buffalo cow belongs
to the Washerman; the front portion belongs to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they asked the Washerman he said, &ldquo;Because the front
portion of the buffalo bull belongs to me, I will not allow him to
plough with the buffalo bull. Because the front portion of the buffalo
cow belongs to the Gamar&#257;hami, the Gamar&#257;hami must attend to
the grazing,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>Then after the assessors had thus asked him they said, &ldquo;What
the Washerman said is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Washerman says, &ldquo;That gentleman (<i lang=
"si-latn">R&#257;hami</i>) will now say that this cloth which I am
wearing is the gentleman&rsquo;s, maybe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la asked, &ldquo;Yes, indeed. Whose is it, Bola, if
that cloth is not mine?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328"
href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Washerman says to the assessors, &ldquo;There! Be good
enough to look. Didn&rsquo;t that gentleman just now say that the cloth
I am wearing is the gentleman&rsquo;s. In that manner, indeed, he has
brought this lawsuit, also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time the assessors said to the Gamar&#257;la, &ldquo;There
is not a thing for us to say regarding this [except that] he is to gain
[the action] against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la having lost, came back with the Washerman to
the village.</p>
<p>At that time, while the Gamar&#257;la was angry with the Washerman,
the Gamar&#257;la, having said that he must build a house for himself,
and having gone to the jungle, cut Halmilla, M&#299;lla, Waewarana
trees; these three sorts [of good timber trees].</p>
<p>Then the Washerman, having got news that he had cut these woods,
also went to the jungle, and having said, &ldquo;I also must build a
house for myself,&rdquo; cut Paepol wood, Murung&#257; wood, Eramudu
wood; those three sorts [of soft useless woods]. After heaping them
together, he wrote a book [of sham prognostications]: &ldquo;For the
house [built] of Halmilla, begging; for the house of Waewarana,
killing; for the house of M&#299;lla, begging; for the house of Paepol,
land; for the house of Eramudu, purity; for the house of Murung&#257;,
purity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After writing these, the Washerman taking up the book while the
Gama-Mahag&#275; (the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s wife) was going past for
water, says them over every day for the Gama-Mahag&#275; to hear. The
Gama-Mahag&#275; having heard them, said to the Gamar&#257;la, &ldquo;A
book of the Washerman&rsquo;s says thus. Because of it, come with the
Washerman, and having given him our small quantity of timber speak with
him to allow us to take his small quantity of timber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Gamar&#257;la having gone to the Washerman, asked at
the hand of the Washerman, &ldquo;Washerman, give me your small
quantity of timber, and take for yourself my small quantity of
timber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Washerman says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know [if I can do it],
Sir (<i lang="si-latn">R&#257;hamiy&#275;</i>). I cannot [willingly],
through sorrow [at the loss to me], give you my small quantity of
timber, indeed; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329"
name="pb329">329</a>]</span>but because the gentleman says it, any way
whatever is good. Be good enough to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Gamar&#257;la brought [home] the Washerman&rsquo;s
small quantity of timber. The Washerman brought the
Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s small quantity of timber. Having brought it, the
Washerman with the small quantity of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s timber
thoroughly built the house for himself, the Gamar&#257;la also building
the house for himself from the Washerman&rsquo;s timber. When only
three months had gone, the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s house fell down, and
the Gama-Mahag&#275;, having been underneath it, died. The house which
the Washerman built from good timber remained in good condition.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Two Thieves</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Two thieves at Cairo were in love with the same girl,
who promised to marry the one who showed the greatest cleverness.</p>
<p>The first one assisted a rich merchant in purchasing some cattle,
and eventually purloined a bag of money which the merchant was carrying
in the large pocket in the front of his gown, and put a similar bag in
its place containing an orange or two.</p>
<p>The theft was discovered when the merchant was about to pay the
money for the cattle. The robber assumed the r&ocirc;le of the
sympathising friend, and suggested that a mistake might have been made
by the merchant&rsquo;s wife, and the wrong bag given to him. The
merchant went home to inquire about it, and on his return the robber
ran up to him, and embraced and kissed him, saying, &ldquo;Hallo,
Friend! I am very glad to see you again. I hope you have succeeded in
finding your money.&rdquo; As he said this he put back the purse, and
took the bag of oranges.</p>
<p>The merchant replied, &ldquo;I hope God will hear what you
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thief said, &ldquo;You are playing me a trick; put your hand in
your pocket, and feel if your purse is not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he put his hand in his breast pocket, and found his bag of money
there. The thief explained the matter, and requested him to relate the
particulars to the girl, who then decided that she would marry this
thief.</p>
<p>I give the rest of the story in full, as it was dictated to
me:&mdash;</p>
<p>The second thief said, &ldquo;Oh! that is nothing. I can
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>play a better trick than that. Will you be kind
enough to come to-morrow morning to the Government offices to see
me?&rdquo; The merchant man said, &ldquo;I also will come to see the
trick.&rdquo; Then the merchant went away, and the three remained there
till evening.</p>
<p>After dinner, the second robber went out to the caf&eacute; to spend
the time, and there he met one of the higher class people. The robber
said, &ldquo;Sal&#257;m,&rdquo; and sat down next this merchant. They
both smoked hashish together, and the thief told him, &ldquo;I have
just arrived from outside the city. The four gates are now shut, and I
cannot return. I do not know where to go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merchant told him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel ashamed to say
that to me when you know what size my house is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robber said, &ldquo;Thank you for the favour,&rdquo; and at the
end of their smoke they went together to the merchant&rsquo;s house.
When the two entered, lights were put in the writing room, with two
beds for them, so that they might sleep together there.</p>
<p>While the merchant was fast asleep and snoring, the robber awoke,
and took the key of the money-box and the seal from the
merchant&rsquo;s pocket, opened the box, counted the money, wrote a
promissory note giving the amount of each kind of money, signed it with
the merchant&rsquo;s seal, and put all back again as before, keeping
the note. He then went to sleep again.</p>
<p>Next morning they breakfasted together, becoming very friendly, and
the robber said, &ldquo;Please can you lend me your horse and a clean
suit of clothes, because I must go to report a person to the
Government?&rdquo; So the merchant gave him a clean suit and a horse,
and told him, &ldquo;You can change your clothes and wash here. I must
go to my office.&rdquo; He then left.</p>
<p>The robber put on the clothes, and rode off to the Government
office, and explained his case, and asked for a man to be sent to fetch
the merchant, as he had to recover a large sum of money from him. The
Chief of the Police sent a man to call him.</p>
<p>When the merchant came, the Chief of the Police asked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span>him,
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you pay this gentleman the money you owe
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;Which gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gentleman,&rdquo; said the Chief of the Police, pointing
to the robber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am the one,&rdquo; said the robber.</p>
<p>The merchant said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel ashamed at saying I
owe you some money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he replied, and then he took out the
promissory note, and handed it to the Chief of the Police.</p>
<p>The Chief of the Police looked at it, and said, &ldquo;Hallo! That
is a big amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merchant asked to see it, and he looked at the list, and said,
&ldquo;I have not got so much money in my box. If I have so much in my
house it must really be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief of the Police sent some men to bring the box to the
station, and on counting the money in it, he found it was exactly the
amount written in the promissory note. The woman, and the other robber,
and the merchant who was tricked on the previous day were all present
and listening, and were all astonished.</p>
<p>The Chief of the Police said, &ldquo;Well, it must be the
claimant&rsquo;s money,&rdquo; and he gave it to him.</p>
<p>The merchant was angry, so the robber said, &ldquo;I suppose you
will be saying next that the horse is yours, and the suit I am
wearing&rdquo;; and when the merchant angrily demanded them the robber
requested the Chief of the Police to lock the man up, because he was
now trying to steal his horse and clothes.</p>
<p>Then the merchant was locked up, and the robber left the money in
the box at the Police Station, and rode off to his own home, where he
met the woman and the first robber. He asked them, &ldquo;How do you
like that trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said, &ldquo;A very clever man you are,&rdquo; and she agreed to
marry him.</p>
<p>After three days they both went to the merchant, and told him the
whole story, and returned him the money, and the horse and clothes. And
the merchant was so pleased <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href=
"#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>to get them back that he gave them
some money to live upon.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Marg&#333;sa Tree</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city there is a King, it is said. The
King thought of growing a Marg&#333;sa tree without bitterness [in the
fruit], so one day he made proclamation accordingly by beat of
tom-toms.</p>
<p>While two friends of one village were coming to seek a means of
subsistence they heard this sound of tom-toms. When they asked at the
hand of a tom-tom beater, &ldquo;What is the sound of tom-toms
for?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;What is it? His Majesty our King will give
presents to any person who should grow and give him a Marg&#333;sa tree
without bitterness.&rdquo; One of the friends, saying, &ldquo;I can [do
it],&rdquo; went to the royal palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canst thou grow and give me a Marg&#333;sa tree without
bitterness?&rdquo; the King asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Majesty,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What things dost thou want for it?&rdquo; the King asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want monthly a hundred-weight of sugar and a large pot of
cow&rsquo;s butter,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, the King asked, &ldquo;Where wilt thou grow
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must grow it on the edge of a river,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Having built and given him a house on the edge of the river, he gave
him a hundred-weight of sugar and a large pot of butter monthly.</p>
<p>Seven times in succession he planted seven trees. Seven times the
seven trees were washed away by the river.</p>
<p>During the time while he was there in that way, the other friend
having come, asked, &ldquo;Where is the tree?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the friend who had planted the tree says, &ldquo;Either the
King, or I, or the river.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9186src"
href="#xd26e9186" name="xd26e9186src">1</a></p>
<p>The words that he said meant, &ldquo;Either His Majesty the King
will die; if not, I shall die, because of no means of
subsistence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having cheated the King I get a living. When it is so, the
foolish King has been caught by my trick.&rdquo;</p>

order to obtain a child. After that they obtained a child. As that
child was growing up the Gamar&#257;la and Gama-g&#257;&#275;ni were
becoming very old.</p>
<p>So one day the Gamar&#257;la says to the Gama-g&#257;&#275;ni,
&ldquo;Before we die we must summon and give a bride to the
youth.&rdquo; Having said this they summoned and gave him a small
girl.</p>
<p>During the time while they were living thus, the Gamar&#257;la had
an illness. After that the Gamar&#257;la died. Afterwards, while the
Gama-g&#257;&#275;ni, and the son, and the son&rsquo;s wife were there,
one day the wife of the Gama-puta (son of the Gamar&#257;la) said,
&ldquo;Now then, let us go to my village, and having gone there, sowing
our rice field lands let us do cultivation&rdquo;; and both of them
went.</p>
<p>While they were there, one day, as an illness settled on the
Gama-puta&rsquo;s wife, the Vedar&#257;la (village doctor) went to see
her. The Vedar&#257;la asked, &ldquo;What is the illness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said, &ldquo;My wife has tumours which are growing
large.&rdquo; The Vedar&#257;la having made a medicine which was to be
rubbed [on the places], and having come to the house gave it, saying,
&ldquo;Rub thou this medicine on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had been rubbing it for four or five days they grew larger.
The Gama-puta having seen this, said, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#257;! These
tumours are becoming very severe. I cannot go for medicine every day if
they go on like this. Let us go to my village.&rdquo; So they set off
to come to the Gama-puta&rsquo;s village.</p>
<p>As they were coming, a man was driving a bull on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>road. This Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s son asked,
&ldquo;Where are you taking the bull?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;I am taking it to my village,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to my village. My wife has tumours. We are going
to apply medical treatment,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? Let us look at them. I also know a little medical
art,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then he showed them. When the man who was taking the bull saw them
he said, &ldquo;They are growing larger; they will never become
well,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the Gama-puta thought, &ldquo;This woman does not matter to
me.&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;It would be good for you to give me that
bull and take this woman.&rdquo; So taking the bull he gave the
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one has water in his stomach (i.e., he had drunk water);
you will be careful,&rdquo; the man said.</p>
<p>Then having taken the bull, as he was going to the village he took a
large cloth and tied it round the middle of the bull. While he was
there after tying it, a man came, carrying a bill-hook on his shoulder.
When he saw it he asked, &ldquo;What is this doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one has water in his stomach; on that account I have
tied the cloth round it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Having seen the bill-hook, &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a bill-hook,&rdquo; the man said.</p>
<p>After he asked, &ldquo;What do you do with the bill-hook?&rdquo; the
man said, &ldquo;Taking a packet of cooked rice and a water-gourd, it
is for cutting the jungle,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>When he asked, &ldquo;Will you take this bull and give me the
bill-hook,&rdquo; the man said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and having
given the bill-hook went away taking the bull.</p>
<p>Then the Gama-puta, having taken the bill-hook, and gone to the
village, during the time while he was there thought he would go to cut
jungle. Having thought so, he took a packet of cooked rice and a
water-gourd, and the bill-hook, and having placed them upon a rock he
remained looking on. Seeing that the bill-hook stayed [there] without
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>cutting the jungle, and thinking that it was
because he was looking at it, he came home.</p>
<p>Having come and eaten rice, and having gone back afterwards, when he
looked, the bill-hook having been put in the sun had become extremely
hot. So the Gama-puta thinks, &ldquo;The bill-hook having got fever, is
it on that account it did not eat the cooked rice and did not cut the
jungle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went quickly for medicine. Having gone he told the Ved&#257;
(village doctor). The Ved&#257; having looked [at it] told him to bury
it under the frame on which the water pots were set. Afterwards, having
come home, he buried it under the water-pots&rsquo; frame. On the
following day, after he had looked [he found that] having become
thoroughly wetted by the water it was cold. Having seen that, he got
into his mind [the notion], &ldquo;A&#7693;&#257;! The medical
treatment is very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a little time had gone, one day the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s wife
had a severe illness, having got fever. The Gama-g&#257;&#275;ni said,
&ldquo;Son, I have much fever. Having gone for medical advice and
brought a little medicine, give me it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and speedily having cut a hole
under the water-pots&rsquo; frame, and put the Gama-g&#257;&#275;ni in
the hole, he covered her with earth.</p>
<p>Afterwards when he looked, the fever having thoroughly gone down she
had become cold like a plantain tree; and saying,
&ldquo;A&#7693;&#257;! Mother&rsquo;s fever is completely well,&rdquo;
he went away.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a village there is a tank. A Crocodile, making a
burrow in the [foot of the] embankment, stayed in it. Afterwards the
mud having dried and become hard, the Crocodile being unable to get out
of the hole was going to die.</p>
<p>As a man was going past to fetch a midwife-mother to attend to his
wife, the Crocodile, hearing him, said to the man, &ldquo;Somehow or
other manage to save me by breaking up the earth so that I may get
out.&rdquo; The man broke up the earth, and let it out.</p>
<p>After that, as there was no water left in the tank, the man, placing
the Crocodile on his shoulder, went to the edge of the river. Having
gone there, after he had placed it in the water<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e9295" title="Not in source">,</span> the Crocodile seized the arm
of that man in order to eat him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wilt thou eat me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Dost thou not
know the help I gave thee? Yet thou art going to eat me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Crocodile said, &ldquo;It is true, indeed, regarding the
assistance. It is because I am hungry that I am going to eat
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;It is good. Eat thou me. There are my
witnesses, two or three persons. First ask them [regarding the justice
of it], and then eat me.&rdquo; So they went to ask the witnesses about
it.</p>
<p>Having met with a Kumbuk tree,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9306src"
href="#xd26e9306" name="xd26e9306src">1</a> he said to the Kumbuk tree,
&ldquo;This Crocodile is going to eat me. I ask this one&rsquo;s
opinion of it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href=
"#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man said, &ldquo;This Crocodile was going to die. I saved it. It
is now going to eat me. Is that right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Kumbuk tree says, &ldquo;O Crocodile-cultivator, do not let
that man go. There is no animal so wicked as that man. He stays near
the tree in the shade, and having broken off the bark and the leaves he
takes them away. At last he cuts down and takes the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From there he goes and asks it of the Cow. &ldquo;O Cow, I saved
this Crocodile from death. This Crocodile is now going to eat me. Do
you think it right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cow says, &ldquo;O Crocodile-cultivator, do not let that man go.
That man is a wicked man. He takes our milk, and at last kills and eats
us. Do not let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that he asks it of the Jackal. The Jackal asks, &ldquo;What is
it about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He says to the Jackal, &ldquo;O Jackal-artificer, without letting
this Crocodile die, I saved it. Now it is going to eat me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jackal-artificer says, &ldquo;I cannot give this decision, not
having seen what is the meaning of it. You must show me the whole
affair from the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man, placing the Crocodile on his shoulder, and having gone
with it and put it in the house in which the Crocodile was at first,
[and closed the entrance], and made the soil hard, the Jackal says,
&ldquo;Now then, don&rsquo;t you be afraid. I am on your
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the man says, &ldquo;Jackal-artificer, hear this
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am both the judge and the witness,&rdquo; the Jackal said.
&ldquo;Now then, taking a cudgel beat thou him until he dies. I saw thy
excellence and this one&rsquo;s wickedness.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is one of the best-known of folk-tales. A Malay
variant is given in <span class="bibl">Mr. W. Skeat&rsquo;s <i>Fables
and Folk-Tales from an Eastern Forest</i>, p. 20</span>. A tiger, being
released from a cage-trap by a man, seized him in order to eat him.
When appealed to, the road and tree were against him. The Mouse-deer,
which in Malaya fills the place of the clever animal in folk-tales, got
the tiger to return to the cage, and called the neighbours to kill
it.</p>
<p>The tiger story is given in <span class="bibl"><i>Old Deccan
Days</i> (Frere), p. 198 ff.</span>, and the appeal was made to a
banyan tree, camel, bullock, eagle, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb341" href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>and alligator
[crocodile], which were against the man. The Jackal settled it in his
favour.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Wide-Awake Stories</i> (Steel and Temple),
p. 116</span>&mdash;<span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Punjab</i>, p.
107</span>&mdash;the matter was referred to a pipal (or b&#333;) tree,
a road, and the Jackal, who induced the tiger to re-enter the trap, and
left him there.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Fairy Tales</i> (Stokes), p.
16</span>, the matter was not referred to others, but the Jackal told
the tiger a good way of eating the man, by getting inside a large bag
and having him thrown in to it. When it was inside the bag, the Jackal,
a dog who was present, and the man tied it up, and beat the tiger to
death.</p>
<p>The <span class="bibl"><i>Panchatantra</i> (Dubois)</span>, as in
several other instances, comes nearest to the Sinhalese story. A
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a carried a Crocodile in a sack from a stream to the
Ganges, and was then seized by it. In reply to his appeal to the
Crocodile&rsquo;s virtue and gratitude, he was told, &ldquo;The virtue
and gratitude of our days is to devour those who nourish us and who do
good to us.&rdquo; Reference was made to a mango tree, an old cow (both
of which agreed with the Crocodile), and a Jackal, who, stating that he
wished to get to the bottom of the matter, induced the Crocodile to
re-enter the sack, after which the Jackal broke his head with a
stone.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i>
(Swynnerton), p. 134</span>, a boy on his way to fetch his bride,
killed a mungus that was attacking a snake, which then turned on him,
to eat him, but gave him eight days&rsquo; grace to get married. When
he returned with his wife she remonstrated with the snake, and was
referred to some trees. One had preserved a thief in its hollow
interior, but he found sandalwood there, and cut it down; and now it
had become a rule to do evil for good. For the future widow&rsquo;s
protection, the snake gave her magic powder capable of reducing to
ashes whatever it fell on, so she applied it to the snake, and burnt it
to dust.</p>
<p>The tale is found in West Africa also, in a form which is very close
to the South Indian and Sinhalese one. In <i lang="fr">Contes
Soudanais</i> (C. Monteil), p. 53, a child found a tired Crocodile, and
carried it back to water. The Crocodile asked if he knew how goodness
was rewarded. &ldquo;By evil,&rdquo; the child said. The Crocodile was
going to eat him, but referred the matter to an old horse and an old
ass (both of which recommended it to do so), and lastly to a Hare,
which refused to believe that the child could have carried it. When
this was proved, and the Crocodile taken back, the Hare said to the
child, &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t thy father eat Crocodile?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;And thy mother?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hast thou not an axe?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have one,&rdquo; the child
replied. &ldquo;Then break the Crocodile&rsquo;s head and eat
it,&rdquo; the Hare said. In many West African tales the Hare is the
clever animal who outwits the others. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">There is a great big mountain. On the mountain there
is a rock-hole [containing water]. In it there are some small fishes.
At all other places a Heron<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9402src" href=

rock-hole the Heron cannot eat the small fishes; he goes along [in the
air], above the rock cave.</p>
<p>On account of it, the Heron puts on a false appearance. &ldquo;I am
indeed an ascetic,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not kill living
creatures,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Thereupon the small fishes came for a talk. After they came he said,
&ldquo;Being in this hole ye cannot go up and down,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Because it is so, I will take you and put you in a river
possessing length and breadth,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After that, having taken them one by one he ate them. At the time
when he was taking the Crab which remained over from them, the Crab
took hold of the neck of the Heron. While on the way, when the Heron
was preparing to kill the Crab, the Crab getting to know of it, cut the
neck of the Heron with his claws and killed it.</p>

having nearly dried up, the fishes<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9424src"

speedily come flying, spoke to the fishes: &ldquo;Friends, I will go
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=

water,&rdquo; he said. They were pleased at it.</p>
<p>The Pond Heron holding one by his bill, and having gone and put it
down at the pool in which there was water, again brought it near those
that were in the pool at which the water had dried up, and let it go.
The fish which he brought informed them that there was a pool in which
there was water, in the way the Heron said. All the fishes that were in
the dried-up pool became wishful to go.</p>
<p>Now then, the Pond Heron having taken them one by one, leaving aside
the pool in which there was water, took them to a tree near it, and ate
them. After not many days the fishes were finished; the Pond Heron ate
all. Having eaten them, below the tree on which he put them there was a
heap of bones to the extent of a tree in height.</p>
<p>Afterwards having seen that a Crab was in the dried-up pool, the
Pond Heron spoke to it: &ldquo;Friend, you also come to be conducted
there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Crab also spoke to the Pond Heron: &ldquo;Friend, my shell is
very thin,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take you carefully,&rdquo; the Pond Heron said. After
he had said it the Crab became wishful to go.</p>
<p>The Pond Heron took hold of his shell, and the Crab took hold of the
neck of the Pond Heron with his two claws. Having taken hold of him the
Pond Heron flew away. Having seen that, leaving the pool on this side,
he was flying to the tree, the Crab spoke to him. &ldquo;The pool is
here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am taking thee to eat,&rdquo; the Pond Heron said.</p>

<p class="first">In a certain country a Pond Heron stayed, it is said.
At the time while the Pond Heron was there, seeking small fishes in the
tanks, a great general drought befel. On account of it all the tanks
dried up. The Pond Heron ate all the small fishes that stayed in them.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span></p>
<p>Having eaten them, he remained hungry for two or three days, there
being no more small fishes. Having been in that state, and having flown
away to seek food, as he was going along he saw that a tank having
dried up, small fishes were there, being unable to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Pond Heron having gone there, asked the small fishes,
&ldquo;What, friends, are you there for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the small fishes said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, the little
water that there was for us having dried up, we are without
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Pond Heron said, &ldquo;If so, friends, there is a
good river for you. I will take you to it, and put you down
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little fishes said, &ldquo;It is good, friend. If so, take us
and put us down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pond Heron said, &ldquo;If so, let one come [first, and see the
river],&rdquo; and holding it with his bill he took it to the river,
and put it down.</p>
<p>That small fish going in the water all round the river came near the
Pond Heron. Then the Pond Heron having said to the small fish,
&ldquo;Let us go, friend,&rdquo; the small fish said, &ldquo;Friend, I
cannot go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pond Heron said, &ldquo;No, friend, let us go. Can you remain,
without going? Your other people are to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the small fish said &ldquo;H&#257;.&rdquo; So the Pond
Heron, taking the small fish with his bill, came flying back. Having
come to a great rough tree, and settled on a branch of the tree, he ate
the small fish.</p>
<p>Again he went flying to the place where the small fishes were. The
small fishes asked, &ldquo;Friend, one of us went with you. Where is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pond Heron replied, &ldquo;Friends, he said he would not come.
He stayed in the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then those small fishes said, &ldquo;If so, go with us, and put us
down in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Pond Heron, taking one of them, settled on the tree
at which he ate that small fish, and ate it. Again he came to the place
where the other small fishes were. Then those small fishes said,
&ldquo;Friend, take us also, and put us in the river.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Pond Heron again having taken a small fish and settled on that
very tree, ate it. Thus, in that way having taken the small fishes
until they were finished, he ate them all.</p>
<p>Having finished the small fishes, a Crab was omitted outside. The
Pond Heron came and asked the Crab, &ldquo;What, friend, are you here
alone for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Crab said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Friend, the small fishes of this
tank went to the quarters where they went. I alone remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Pond Heron said, &ldquo;Friend, shall I take you also to
the river, and put you down in it?&rdquo; The Crab said
&ldquo;H&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Pond Heron, holding the Crab with his bill, took it
and settled on the tree on which he ate the small fishes. While he was
there the Crab asked, &ldquo;What, friend, have you delayed here
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Pond Heron said, &ldquo;It is here that I ate also the few
small fishes that stayed in the tank. It is here I shall eat you
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Crab, having stiffened his claws a little, seized the
neck of the Pond Heron. Then the Pond Heron with his bill tightened his
hold of the Crab. Thus, in that way holding each other, both of them
died, and fell on the ground below the tree.</p>

<p class="first">The <span class="bibl">J&#257;taka story No. 38 (vol.
i, p. 96)</span>, about a Crane and a Crab, nearly agrees with the
second of these tales, but the ending is like that of the first one,
the Crab killing the Crane. It is also much more artificial and
developed in the conversations.</p>
<p>It is possible that the story related by the Duray&#257; may
represent a very early form of the tale, or perhaps the original one.
If the story were derived from the J&#257;taka tale, it is very
improbable that in a country where ponds are more numerous than in any
other, we should find the pool of the J&#257;taka, to which the fishes
were to be taken, displaced in two of these by a river.</p>
<p>The story is given in <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Fables</i>

a pond, and was killed by a Crab.</p>

<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Panchatantra</i> (Dubois)</span>, a
Cormorant came to the fishes at a pool, and allayed their suspicions by
putting on an appearance of piety and by alleging that he had become a
religious devotee. He informed them that he foresaw a twelve
years&rsquo; drought, in which the pools would dry up and they would
perish, and he offered to transport them to a mountain pool fed by a
perennial spring. They were eaten on a rock, and the Crab strangled the
bird.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i>
(Tawney), vol. ii, p. 31</span>, the animals were a Crane and a
<i>Makara</i>, which is said by the translator to generally mean a
crocodile, though in early carvings in Ceylon and India it is a
fabulous animal with two short legs and a tail usually curved upon its
back. The bird frightened the fish by saying that a man was coming to
catch them with a net, and he offered to convey them to a lake. When
the Makara was taken to the rock at which the others were killed, he
cut off the Crane&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>This story nearly agrees with that in the <span class=
"bibl"><i>Hit&#333;padesa</i></span>, in which a Crab killed the bird.

<h2 class="main">The Jackal and the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain city a Jackal according to custom was
eating the fowls, it is said. Now, as the Jackal was there eating the
fowls, by degrees he finished all the fowls in that manner. There was
still one fowl at the royal palace.</p>
<p>So this Jackal went to the royal palace to eat the fowl. After he
had come there the Jackal tried to catch it, and while he was there
striving to eat the fowl it became light. There being no means of going
away because of the people, he sought a place in which to remain
hidden. As he was seeking it, except that there was open ground and no
jungle, when he looked there was only a clump of weeds as a hiding
place.</p>
<p>While he was in it peeping out, a Br&#257;hma&#7751;a comes near.
This Jackal asked, &ldquo;You Br&#257;hma&#7751;a! Where art thou
going?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The Br&#257;hma&#7751;a says, &ldquo;I am going in search of a
livelihood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jackal says, &ldquo;I will give thee a means of subsistence;
carry me here and there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a taking the Jackal slung him by his four
legs. &ldquo;Dost thou carry me by the legs to some place to give a
livelihood to thee?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If not, how shall I carry thee?&rdquo; the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a asked.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal says, &ldquo;Having placed me in thy upper garment
take me up and go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look here! Take me and go
thou along the road which leads to this jungle,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Having taken me and gone on it there will be a clump of wild
dates. Do thou put me down near the clump of wild dates,&rdquo; he
said. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span></p>
<p>So the Jackal came to the open ground in the bundle. Then the Jackal
told this Br&#257;hma&#7751;a, after he had placed the bundle on the
ground, to stay looking in the direction of the sun. Having remained
looking in the direction of the sun, he told him to look in the
direction of the clump of wild dates, and to take the kahawa&#7751;as
(coins) which were placed in it. When he had looked in the direction of
the clump of wild dates, the rays of the sun having entered his eyes a
yellow colour went into everything, and he thought he saw some money in
it.</p>
<p>So the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a crept into the clump of wild dates and
passed his hand through it, and looked through it. Then because there
were no kahawa&#7751;as, he came out into the open ground.</p>
<p>When he looked on the path there was no Jackal. Then the
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a said, &ldquo;There is neither the journey that I
came for, nor the kahawa&#7751;as. A&#7693;&#257;!
A&#7693;&#257;!&rdquo; So he went away.</p>

<p class="first">In this story we find one of the lowest castes of the
Cha&#7751;&#7693;&#257;las making fun of the highest caste of all, a
mild revenge for their treatment by the latter. As part of the joke,
the Jackal is represented as addressing the Br&#257;hma&#7751;a in the
manner in which the latter would have spoken to a Duray&#257;, and as
being carried about by him, thus turning the tables completely, the
chief duty of the Duray&#257;s being carrying loads for others.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p>In the J&#257;taka story No. 113 (vol. i, p. 255) a Jackal having
overslept himself in some bushes in Benares, concealed himself until a
Br&#257;hma&#7751;a came near. By promising him two hundred gold pieces
he induced the man to carry him concealed under his robe until they
reached the cremation ground. There he told him to dig up a tree in
order to get the treasure, and then ran off while the man was occupied
with the work. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A Cat having seen that a sun-dried fish was in a bag
of rice, at the time when he was going to it to eat it, a rosary
[hanging there] fell on his neck.</p>
<p>After it had fallen, as he was going away with it on his neck a
Jungle-hen met him, and ran off. The Cat then says, &ldquo;I am
guarding (that is, keeping) the Precepts (of Buddha, <i lang=
"si-latn">sil rakinaw&#257;</i>). Tummal Kitt&#299;,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e9621src" href="#xd26e9621" name="xd26e9621src">1</a> come here
and go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was taking her with him they met with a Ground Cuckoo. He
called this one: &ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Bug-bug&rsquo;-singing
K&#257;ccal&#275;,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9626src" href=
"#xd26e9626" name="xd26e9626src">2</a> I am guarding the Precepts. Come
here and go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were going they met with a Hare. He called him also:
&ldquo;Tokk&#257;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9646src" href="#xd26e9646"
name="xd26e9646src">3</a> the Devil-dancer, come here and go with me. I
am guarding the Precepts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gone to a rock cave [as a pansala or monk&rsquo;s residence],
while they were there the Cat said, &ldquo;Tokk&#257; the Devil-dancer,
Tummal Kitt&#299; having scratched [the ground] in the pansala has
defiled it. I must kill this one,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>When the Hare said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; he killed her.</p>
<p>After the Cat had said, &ldquo;It is not a fault to eat a dead one,
is it?&rdquo; when the Hare replied, &ldquo;No, there is not any fault
in it,&rdquo; he ate her.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Cat said, &ldquo;Tokk&#257; the Devil-dancer, this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=

has been drinking arrack (palm spirit) until his eyes have become
red.&rdquo; When he said, &ldquo;I must kill this one,&rdquo; he killed
it. Then saying, &ldquo;There is no fault in eating a dead one,&rdquo;
he ate it.</p>
<p>Then he said, &ldquo;Tokk&#257; the Devil-dancer, thou having
dropped dung in the pansala art defiling it.&rdquo; When he said,
&ldquo;I must kill thee,&rdquo; the Hare said, &ldquo;Yes, killing me
is virtuous and proper. I must first perform a great gallop<a class=

and a little gallop, two gallops.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9674src"
href="#xd26e9674" name="xd26e9674src">5</a> After that there will be no
fault if you kill me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, perform them,&rdquo; the Cat said.</p>
<p>Then the Hare having run round [the cave], &ldquo;There! The small
gallop,&rdquo; he said. Again having gone running round, and [then]
having jumped over the Cat&rsquo;s head, while he was running away he
said, &ldquo;There! The great gallop,&rdquo; and ran off.</p>

<p class="first">At a certain time, at the house of a Gamar&#257;la,
milk having been taken and placed on the shelf by him [to curdle], the
Gamar&#257;la went to the chena.</p>
<p>There is a Cat at the house. The Cat having looked [to see] when the
Gamar&#257;la was not there, went to the shelf to eat the curds by
stealth. Having gone there and eaten them by stealth, as he was coming
away the Gamar&#257;la came home from the chena, and the Cat, becoming
afraid, sprang down.</p>
<p>The Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s rosary was hanging on the shelf. As the
Cat deceitfully was springing down, the rosary fell on the Cat&rsquo;s
neck. Then while the rosary was on its neck it goes away. Why? Should
the Gamar&#257;la get to know about its eating the curds he would
thrash it inordinately.</p>
<p>Well then, as it was going it met with a Rat. The Rat [seeing the
rosary] asked the Cat, &ldquo;Up&#257;sakar&#257;la,<a class="noteref"

<p>&ldquo;I am going to guard the Precepts,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
also come and go along with me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>At the time when the two were going they met with the Squirrel
called the Three-lined Chief.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9712src" href=
"#xd26e9712" name="xd26e9712src">8</a> &ldquo;Up&#257;sakar&#257;la,
where are you going?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to guard the Precepts. You also come and go with
us,&rdquo; he said. The Squirrel having said, &ldquo;H&#257;. I will
come,&rdquo; the three went along [together].</p>
<p>As they were going they met with the Ground Cuckoo called Bum-bum
the Tom-tom Beater. &ldquo;Where, Up&#257;sakar&#257;la, are you
going?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to guard the Precepts. You also come,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The Ground Cuckoo having said, &ldquo;H&#257;. If so, I also will
come,&rdquo; the four went together.</p>
<p>At the time when they were going they met with the Hare called
Tokkan the Devil-dancer. &ldquo;Up&#257;sakar&#257;las, where are you
going?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to guard the Precepts. You also come and go with
us,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Well then, the five went to the jungle. Having gone on and on, there
was a rock cave. Having said, &ldquo;Look there! Our pansala,&rdquo; he
told the people to creep inside. &ldquo;In order that I may go and
rehearse the Precepts, let no single other person besides cause any
disturbance,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the Rat, being hungry during the night, was wriggling about. So
the <span class="corr" id="xd26e9737" title=
"Source: Up&#257;saka">Up&#257;sak&#257;</span> Cat said,
&ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! While Bum-bum the Tom-tom Beater stays there
quietly, while the Three-lined Chief stays there [quietly], while
Tokkan the Devil-dancer stays there [quietly], this one does not take
[to heart] the things that were said. Being on guard over it I must put
it out of the way.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9740src" href=
"#xd26e9740" name="xd26e9740src">9</a> Saying this, he ate the Rat.</p>
<p>At the daybreak watch the Ground Cuckoo crowed [as usual]. After it
had crowed, the Cat said, &ldquo;While the Three-lined Chief stays
there [quietly], while Tokkan the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352"
href="#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span>Devil-dancer stays there
[quietly], because this one is making noises, and as I am on guard over
it, I must put it out of the way,&rdquo; and seizing that one also he
ate it.</p>
<p>As it became light in the morning, at the time when the Squirrels
were singing, &ldquo;Tin&#805;-Tin&#805;,&rdquo; the Three-lined Chief
also sang, &ldquo;Tin&#805;-Tin&#805;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Cat said, &ldquo;While Tokkan the Devil-dancer stays there
quietly, and I stay here [quietly], this one having said it through
arrogance, and as I am on guard over it, I must put it out of the
way.&rdquo; Having said this he ate that one also.</p>
<p>Now then, the Hare called Tokkan the Devil-dancer ascertaining that
he was eating it, began to cry in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Tokkan the Devil-dancer, are you crying for?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know thoroughly how to dance dances. Because there is no
one to look at the dances I was sorry,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>After he had said, &ldquo;If so, dance a little for me to look at
it,&rdquo; the Hare said, &ldquo;Up&#257;sakar&#257;la, open the
doorway so that a little light may fall into the cave. Having seen my
dance you must eat me also,&rdquo; the Hare said.</p>
<p>When he moved from the door, out of the way, for a little light to
fall inside, the Hare, having jumped to the four corners of the cave,
springing over the head of the Cat went away.</p>

The Cat every day goes to eat by stealth in the villages. On account of

bell<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9778src" href="#xd26e9778" name=
"xd26e9778src">10</a> on its neck, let it go.</p>
<p>After that, the Cat, without going that day into the village, went
away along the path. As it was going along it met with a Rat. The Rat
asked the Cat, &ldquo;Where, O Cat-Lord, are you going?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=

<p>Then the Cat said, &ldquo;I am going for Bell Worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rat asked, &ldquo;Shall I come too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cat said, &ldquo;It is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rat also having set off, as the two were going away they met
with a Squirrel. The Squirrel asked the Cat, &ldquo;Where, O Cat-Lord,
are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Cat said, &ldquo;I am going for Bell Worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Squirrel asked, &ldquo;Shall I come too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, the Cat said, &ldquo;It is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now then, the Squirrel having set off, as the three were going away
they met with a Jungle-cock. The Jungle-cock asked the Cat,
&ldquo;Where, O Cat-Lord, are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Cat said, &ldquo;I am going for Bell Worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jungle-cock said, &ldquo;I shall come too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To that the Cat said, &ldquo;It is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jungle-cock having set off, the four persons went to a great
rock cave in the jungle. Having made those three remain in the
direction of the corner, the Cat stayed at the doorway.</p>
<p>After being there [a short time], the Cat first of all said to the
Rat, &ldquo;O Rat,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9812src" href=
"#xd26e9812" name="xd26e9812src">11</a> I am hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Rat said, &ldquo;Let it be according to the wish of the
Cat-Lord.&rdquo; After that, the Cat, seizing the Rat, ate it.</p>
<p>In a little more time the Cat said to the Squirrel, &ldquo;O
Squirrel,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9820src" href="#xd26e9820" name=
"xd26e9820src">12</a> I am hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time the Squirrel also said, &ldquo;Let it be according to
the wish of the Cat-Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the Cat having seized the Squirrel also, ate it.</p>
<p>In a little more time the Cat said to the Jungle-cock, &ldquo;O
Jungle-cock,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9830src" href="#xd26e9830"
name="xd26e9830src">13</a> I am hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time the Jungle-cock said falsely, &ldquo;Let it be
according to the wish of the Cat-Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the Cat was approaching very near the Jungle-cock,
having sprung at the Cat&rsquo;s face and with his spurs having plucked
out both his eyes, the Jungle-cock flew away. The Cat there and then
died.</p>

<p class="first">The Precepts of Buddha to which reference is made in
the first two stories, are the A&#7789;a-sil, or Eight Precepts, the
keeping of which by lay devotees, called Up&#257;sak&#257;s, is a
necessary obligation. The first one prohibits the taking of life. The
others are against theft, immorality, lying, drinking intoxicants,
eating after noon, attendance at theatrical amusements, dancing,
singing, etc., and personal adornment.</p>
<p>In the J&#257;taka story No. 128 (vol. i, p. 281) there is an
account of a Jackal who pretended to lead a saintly life, standing on
one leg because the earth could not support his weight if he stood on
all four, he said. He ate the rats which came to pay their respects to
him, always seizing the hindmost as they left. The King of the Rats
waited till the others had gone, and then sprang at the Jackal&rsquo;s
throat and killed him. The next story, No. 129, is similar.</p>
<p>In No. 384 (vol. iii, p. 170) a Crow pretended to be a saint, and
also stood on one leg for the same reason, saying that it fed only on
wind. When the other birds left it in charge of their young ones it ate
them. At last it was killed by the other birds.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Mah&#257; Bh&#257;rata</i> (Udyoga

that placed themselves under its protection.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Hit&#333;padesa</i></span> a Cat which

young ones.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i>

<h2 class="main">The Lizard and the Leopard</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At a village there are a Leopard and a
Lizard.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9879src" href="#xd26e9879" name=
"xd26e9879src">1</a> The Lizard and Leopard cut a chena, it is said.
Afterwards both having quarrelled they divided the chena between them.
In the part which the Lizard got he planted Kaekiri creepers, which
became large; in the part which the Leopard got the Kaekiri died, and
he abandoned it.</p>
<p>Then the Leopard ate the Kaekiri fruit in the Lizard&rsquo;s chena,
and after eating rubbed himself on his hams over the fruits that were
on the ground. So the Lizard gave some Kaekiri fruits to the smith, and
having got a small knife made took it away. After getting it made, the
Lizard ran it through some plucked Kaekiri fruits [and left it
there].</p>
<p>Afterwards the Leopard came to eat Kaekiri. Having eaten, he rubbed
himself on the plucked Kaekiri fruits. Then the knife pierced him. Over
this matter the Leopard and Lizard quarrelled. Afterwards the Leopard,
having eaten cattle flesh, became strong again.</p>
<p>One day the Leopard told the Lizard that the Gamar&#257;la had a
chena. The Lizard said, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Where is it? Let me look
at it.&rdquo; Having gone with him to it, the Leopard shows him the
fruits and says, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Lizard, eat thou there. Lizard,
eat thou here.&rdquo; The Gamar&#257;la having heard it and having gone
home, began to laugh. The Gama-Mahag&#275; (his wife) asked,
&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; The Gamar&#257;la said,
&ldquo;A Leopard sitting in the chena was saying and saying to a
Lizard, &lsquo;Eat thou there, Lizard. Eat thou here,
Lizard.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href=
"#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span></p>
<p>Afterwards, when the Lizard was in the chena the Leopard goes to the
house of the Gamar&#257;la and says, &ldquo;Gamar&#257;la, see! The
Lizard is eating thy chena.&rdquo; Then the Gamar&#257;la scolded him
and said, &ldquo;I heard thee telling the Lizard, &lsquo;Eat thou
there, Lizard. Eat thou here, Lizard.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Leopard went to the Lizard, and said, &ldquo;Friend, take
thou my piece of chena, and give me thy piece of chena.&rdquo; Because
the Lizard was afraid he said, &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; and they
exchanged chenas. The Lizard planted the abandoned piece in a thorough
manner. The Leopard ate the fruits in the part which he got, until they
were finished.</p>
<p>After that, the Leopard went to the Lizard again, and said,
&ldquo;Friend, let us exchange chenas again.&rdquo; The Lizard felt
anger which he could not bear, but because he was afraid he said again,
&ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; to that also.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Lizard went to a man, and asked him to tell him a
way of succeeding, so as to fight the Leopard. The man said,
&ldquo;When he asks you again, say you will not. The Leopard will come
and quarrel with you. Then say, &lsquo;We cannot fight in that manner.
You go, and after asking your mother about a means of success, return.
I will go, and after asking my mother about a means of success, will
return.&rsquo; Having said it and come away, and having rolled in the
mud and dried it, and again rolled in the mud and dried it, by rolling
in the mud and doing thus you will become big. After that go to fight.
The Leopard&rsquo;s claws will not enter your body.&rdquo; All this the
man told the Lizard.</p>
<p>Afterwards, one day the Leopard said, &ldquo;Let us exchange
chenas.&rdquo; The Lizard told him as the man said. When the Leopard
went to his mother she told him to rub coconut oil over his body.</p>
<p>The Lizard having gone to a mud hole, jumps into it, and climbs onto
a post to dry the mud. Again it jumps into the mud and climbs onto the
post. Thus, having acted in that manner he caused much mud to be
smeared on his body.</p>
<p>After that, having met each other, the Leopard and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>Lizard quarrelled again, and struck each other
on the face. Then the Lizard springs on the Leopard&rsquo;s back and
scratches his flesh. The Leopard jumps about, but only scratches mud
off the Lizard.</p>
<p>Having fought in that way, the Leopard, becoming afraid, went away.
The Lizard went and washed off the mud. The Leopard having gone and
crawled under the corn store at a house, while sitting there says,
&ldquo;Bite thou me here, too, Lizard. Bite thou me here, too,
Lizard.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9913src" href="#xd26e9913"
name="xd26e9913src">2</a> While he was there saying it he saw a boy
[near him]. Then the Leopard says, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Do not tell
any one, or I will kill thee.&rdquo; Because of it, the boy being
afraid did not tell any one.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Leopard, thinking, &ldquo;The boy will tell
it,&rdquo; came while the boy<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9918src" href=
"#xd26e9918" name="xd26e9918src">3</a> was asleep on the bed [in the
veranda], and having crept under the bed, lifted it on his back and
went off with it, in order to eat him. When the boy awoke and saw that
the Leopard was going along carrying him, he caught hold of a branch
and hung by it. After the Leopard, having gone a long distance, looked
back the boy was not there.</p>
<p>Then the Leopard came running back to seek him. Having seen that the
boy was on a branch, the Leopard asked, &ldquo;Art thou descending to
the ground, boy? I shall eat thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy said, &ldquo;A&#7693;&#275;! Bola, art thou saying
Ba&#7751;a?<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9925src" href="#xd26e9925" name=
"xd26e9925src">4</a> I have no means of stretching out my hands to
descend,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is in thy hands?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this hand I have small Lizard&rsquo;s eggs; in this other
hand I have large Lizard&rsquo;s eggs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A sort of
Lizards as big as Talipat trunks and Coconut trunks will be
coming.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the Leopard, saying, &ldquo;Stay thou there, boy, until I have
run a little far,&rdquo; bounded off and ran away.</p>

<p class="first">In <span class="bibl"><i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. i,
p. 117 ff.</span>, the latter part of this tale was given by Miss J. A.
Goonetilleke, containing the fight of the animals and the incidents
that follow it. The animals were a &ldquo;Bloodsucker&rdquo; Lizard and
a &ldquo;tiger,&rdquo; a word often used in Ceylon where
&ldquo;leopard&rdquo; is intended to be understood. There are no tigers
in Ceylon.</p>
<p>An incident like that in the chena, in which the knife wounded the
Leopard, is found in <span class="bibl"><i>Old Deccan Days</i> (Frere),
p. 177</span>. In it a barber tied a knife to a cucumber, and it
wounded a Jackal who began to eat the fruit.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Wide-Awake Stories</i> (Steel and Temple),
p. 240</span>&mdash;<span class="bibl"><i>Tales of the Punjab</i>, p.
227</span>&mdash;a woman who was being carried off by robbers while on
her bed, seized a branch and climbed up a tree when they paused under a
Banyan tree. The same incident is given in <span class="bibl"><i>The
Orientalist</i>, vol. i, p. 40</span>.</p>
<p>With regard to the fear of the lizard which the leopard is described
in the Sinhalese story as exhibiting, I am able to state that it is not
much exaggerated. Many years ago, on returning to my bungalow one day,
at a tank in a wild part of the jungle, I found that a lizard of the
species mentioned in this tale&mdash;a Ka&#7789;uss&#257; or
&ldquo;Bloodsucker&rdquo;&mdash;had entered my bedroom. I brought up a
tame, full-grown leopard which I then had, and introduced it to the
lizard, as a new experience for it. At first it was inclined to play
with the lizard, but on pretending to seize it with its mouth it felt
the spikes on the lizard&rsquo;s back, and immediately showed the
greatest fear of it. The attempts which it made to escape when the
lizard came in its direction were quite ridiculous, and it became so
terrified that I was obliged to take it away to the security of its
den, a large packing-case under a tree to which it was tethered,
leaving the lizard the complete master of the situation, though
probably nearly equally alarmed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359"

<h2 class="main">The Lion and the Jackal</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While an old Lion was in a rock cave, after a Jackal
went there the Lion says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Bola, I have been thinking
of eating fresh pig&rsquo;s flesh.&rdquo; When he said, &ldquo;When I
ran and sprang at some Boars now I couldn&rsquo;t catch one,&rdquo; the
Jackal said, &ldquo;If it come near this cave can&rsquo;t you seize it,
Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that way I can still do it. But will a Boar come near me?
The thing you are saying would be a wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jackal says, &ldquo;Somehow or other I will bring a
Boar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jackal having walked about in the jungle, and having seen a
Boar, says, &ldquo;How many days have I now been seeking thee!&rdquo;
After he had said, &ldquo;Why should I be of assistance to thee?&rdquo;
the Boar says, &ldquo;Uwah! Why is there so much need of it by me? Thou
wilt not be of any assistance to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jackal said, &ldquo;Our King is there, having now become old. Is
it true or not, Cultivator, that as he told me to seek a person to give
the sovereignty to, I have been going about seeking thee? If not, am I
telling lies? Come along and go there with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gone near the Lion, taking him with him, the Jackal says,
&ldquo;Now then, having gone near the King and made obeisance, take the
sovereignty.&rdquo; As the Boar was approaching in great fear the Lion
sprang at him. After he had seized him, the Boar, pushing off his paws,
bounded away.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal says, &ldquo;Did a thunderbolt strike you, Sir? Why
didn&rsquo;t you hold the Boar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lion says, &ldquo;An&#275;! Bola, did I fail? Are you saying
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>it falsely? When will such a Boar come near me
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the King was sorrowful the Jackal says, &ldquo;Are you mad, Sir,
that you doubt my powers? I will bring that one again now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jackal having gone on the path on which the Boar went, and
having seen the Boar says, &ldquo;What is the matter with thee?
A&#7693;&#275;! Did a thunderbolt strike thee, that thou camest
bounding away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Boar says, &ldquo;What did I come away for? Truly, I was running
away. If I had stayed there it would be seen why!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Jackal says, &ldquo;If thou hadst stopped he wouldn&rsquo;t
eat thee. Art thou a person afraid to have the sovereignty bestowed on
thee? What was it? Except that he merely looked at thee he did not
attempt to eat thee, Cultivator. If he had done so wouldst thou be
thus?<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10007src" href="#xd26e10007" name=
"xd26e10007src">1</a> No. Did he attempt the crime of eating
thee?&rdquo; [At last the Boar agreed to return to the Lion.]</p>
<p>Afterwards, when they went near the Lion together, the Jackal says,
&ldquo;Friend, go without fear, and tell him to hand over the
sovereignty.&rdquo; In that manner the Boar went near the Lion.</p>
<p>Having sprung with great force on the neck of the Boar, and broken
the neck, and broken the bone of the head, as he was going to eat the
brains the Jackal said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Lion asked, &ldquo;Why not, Bola?&rdquo; the Jackal says,
&ldquo;Though you, Sir, exercise the sovereignty your wisdom is less
than ours. Do kings eat and drink in that manner?&rdquo; After he had
said, &ldquo;Blood has fallen on your body, Sir. Having gone to the
river, bathing and drying your body there, and having returned, be good
enough to eat sitting down,&rdquo; the Lion went to bathe.</p>
<p>After he had caused him to go, the Jackal ate the Boar&rsquo;s
brains, and remained there silently. The Lion having come back, and
taken the skull in his paws, sought for the brain in order to eat it.
When he said, &ldquo;There is no brain,&rdquo; the Jackal said,
&ldquo;Sir, don&rsquo;t you know so much? Having <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>once
escaped death and gone away, would he again be caught for killing if he
had had brains? That one had no brains,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">How the Jackal Cheated the
Lion.</span> (Variant.)</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a more ancient time than this, a Lion King dwelt in
a certain forest. A Jackal who lived in that very forest, establishing
a friendly state with the Lion began to reside near him. Should I state
the mutual trust of them both [it was this]&mdash;the Lion knew that
although by the aid of the Jackal&rsquo;s means of success (that is,
advice and stratagems), the Lion was seizing and eating the flesh of
other animals, he did not get from the Jackal any other assistance that
ought to be given.</p>
<p>When a little time had passed in that way, it was evident that the
Jackal&rsquo;s body was becoming very fat. The Lion saw it, and
assuming a false illness remained lying down at the time when the
Jackal came. Having seen it, the Jackal made obeisance to the Lion, and
asked, &ldquo;What, O Lord, are you lying down for? Has some ailment
befallen Your Majesty? Are you not going to hunt to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Lion said, &ldquo;My friend Jackal, a headache having
afflicted me to-day, I am in a very serious state. From this time
onward, having hunted, and eaten only the small amount of the brains of
the animals, I will give thee all the rest of the flesh. Do thou
subsist on it. For the reason that I am not well enough to go to hunt
this day, thou and I, both of us, must remain hungry. Art thou unable
to go hunting [alone] this day only?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Thereupon the Jackal said to the Lion, &ldquo;O Lord, is that which
should be done a difficult thing? Your Majesty will stay thus. I will
go, and will return calling some animal or other [to come] near Your
Majesty.&rdquo; Having instructed him to spring up and seize it as soon
as it comes, the Jackal went to seek animals.</p>
<p>While going for this purpose [it saw that] a Goat was tied in a
field. Having told many falsehoods to the Goat it returned, inviting it
[to come] near the Lion. Then the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362"
href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>Lion sprang to seize it.
Thereupon the Goat, having become afraid, ran away. The Jackal went
[after it], and causing it to turn back again, returned [with it].</p>
<p>Then the Lion, having killed the Goat, went to bathe in order [to
purify himself, so as] to eat the small quantity of brains. In the
meantime the Jackal removed the brains, and having eaten them replaced
the skin.</p>
<p>The Lion having returned after bathing, when he came to split open
the skin in order to eat the brains, saw that there were no brains.
Having seen it, the Lion asked the Jackal, &ldquo;Where are my
brains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the Jackal said, &ldquo;O Lord, if this one had any brains
would it have come twice near Your Majesty? It came twice because it
had no brains.&rdquo; So saying the Jackal ate the small quantity of
flesh also.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Improbable as the notion appears that an animal, other
than insects or fishes, would return into the same danger shortly after
escaping from it, one instance of this has come under the observation
of myself and a friend, with whose approval I insert this account of
the occurrence.</p>
<p>As Mr. H. E. H. Hayes, late of the Public Works Department, Ceylon,
was walking one day near the water, at the embankment of the
Vil&#257;nkul&#803;am tank in the Northern Province, a crocodile made
its appearance suddenly in the water near him, apparently attracted by
his young terrier. He fired a charge of snipe shot at its head, and it
disappeared.</p>
<p>He and I went to the spot on the following day. I remained on the
look-out on the top of the bank, while he was partly hidden behind a
tree nearer the water. There he tweaked or pinched the dog so as to
make it yelp a little. Then we observed a crocodile&rsquo;s head raised
among some weeds far out in the tank. Not many minutes afterwards the
crocodile&rsquo;s head appeared out of the water only a few feet away
from the dog. Mr. Hayes at once shot it with his rifle; and when he
recovered it found the shot marks of the previous day in its head.</p>
<p>In this case it might almost be said with truth that the animal had
no brains, since the brain of an ordinary tank crocodile is only about
the size of a large walnut. When I split the skull of one, the men who
were with me could not find the brain cavity, and thought it had no
brains.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i>,
Panj&#257;b (Swynnerton), p. 268</span>, a Tiger with a broken leg
takes the place of the Lion, and a Jackal <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb363" href="#pb363" name="pb363">363</a>]</span>brought an Ass to eat
what he represented to be the superior grass at the place. After the
Tiger had killed it and eaten part of it, he crawled to a spring for a
drink, and in his absence the Jackal ate the heart (which the Tiger
wanted itself), and gave the same explanation of its absence. The
author added a note, &ldquo;the heart among the Punj&#257;b&#299;s
being the seat of reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Panchatantra</i> (Dubois)</span>, an
Ass was brought to a sick Lion King in order that he might eat the
heart and ears, as a remedy for his illness. When he was brought back
the second time by a Jackal, the Lion killed him and ate the heart and
ears.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl"><i>Kath&#257; Sarit S&#257;gara</i>
(Tawney), p. 85</span>, there is a similar story, except that after
killing the Ass the Lion went to bathe, and the Jackal then ate the
heart and ears. He told the Lion that &ldquo;the creature never
possessed ears or a heart, otherwise how could he have returned when he
had once escaped?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href=

<h2 class="main">The Roll of Cotton</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there is a city. In the city
there are two persons, an elder sister and a younger sister. There are
two female children of the two persons.</p>
<p>The younger sister took to spinning cotton. At that time her
daughter also came there. A roll of cotton was driven away in the wind
out of the daughter&rsquo;s hand. Then her mother beat the daughter.
&ldquo;Wherever it should go do thou bring back the roll of
cotton,&rdquo; she said. This girl, weeping and weeping, follows the
roll of cotton.</p>
<p>She came to a betel plot which a lame man had made. To this girl who
was following the roll of cotton the lame man says, &ldquo;An&#275;!
Pour water on this betel plot and go, please,&rdquo; he said.
Afterwards, having poured it she went on. &ldquo;The betel has been
plucked,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>As she was going [she came to a place where] a dog was tied.
&ldquo;An&#275;! Younger sister, tie me in the shade and go,
please,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;While you are going home to-morrow there
will be a haunch of a bull tied up [for you],&rdquo; he said. So having
tied the dog in the shade she went on.</p>
<p>Then the roll of cotton having gone on, stopped in a cane-brake. At
that time a King came there. That girl was tying hooked sticks in order
to get the roll of cotton. So the King said, &ldquo;I will bring the
roll of cotton. Go thou to the royal palace and cook,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The girl went and cooked. The King got the roll of cotton. The King
having gone, gave the roll of cotton to the girl. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span></p>
<p>After he had given it, both of them ate the cooked rice. After they
had eaten it the King called the girl to the house. Having called her,
he said to the girl, &ldquo;Please take from these boxes any box thou
wantest,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the girl, having looked at them, took a small sandalwood
box.</p>
<p>Afterwards the King said, &ldquo;This will provide a livelihood for
the persons who are rearing thee, also,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Taking the box, she came near the dog that was tied up. There the
dog had tied up the haunch of a bull. Having taken the haunch of the
bull from there, she came near the lame man. Having got betel from
there, she came near her mother at the girl&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Having come there she opened that box. Having opened it, after she
looked [in it she found that] the box was full of silver and gold; the
box had been filled. Then that other elder sister and the elder
sister&rsquo;s daughter saw these articles [and heard how the girl
obtained them].</p>
<p>On the following day that mother and daughter took to spinning
cotton. Afterwards, from the mother&rsquo;s hand by force a roll of
cotton was carried away [by the wind]; having been carried away she
beat the daughter, and told her to bring the roll of cotton. So this
daughter, weeping and weeping, goes after the roll of cotton.</p>
<p>She goes near the lame man who is making the betel plot. Then the
lame man said, &ldquo;Please pour water [on these plants].&rdquo;
Having said, &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; she went by the place where the
dog was. The dog said, &ldquo;An&#275;! Elder sister, tie me in the
shade and go. As you go [home] I will place a haunch of a bull for
you,&rdquo; he said. Having said she would not she went away.</p>
<p>The roll of cotton having gone into the very cane-brake, that also
stopped there. Then this girl was tying hooked sticks in order to get
the roll of cotton. Then the King [came there, and] said, &ldquo;I will
bring the roll of cotton. Go thou to the palace and cook,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The girl having gone, without any deficiency cooked rice and
vegetables. The King having taken the roll of cotton [there], both of
them went to eat the rice. Having gone <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb366" href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>and looked [at it in
order] to eat it, they could not eat it; it had the taste of water.</p>
<p>Having called the girl he said, &ldquo;From these please take for
thyself any box thou wantest,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>This one having searched and searched, took in her arms a great
chest. Afterwards the King said, &ldquo;Go thou; please open the box at
the place where thy mother and father are,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The girl, after it became night, having summoned every one,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e10133src" href="#xd26e10133" name=
"xd26e10133src">1</a> opened the box. All [the things] in the box were
cobras and polang&#257;s. The cobras and polang&#257;s having bitten
the people of the village, destroyed them. They made all the village
desolate.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Jackal and the Leopard</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country there is a Gamar&#257;la. There
is a goat-fold of the Gamar&#257;la&rsquo;s. At that goat-fold one by
one the goats are disappearing during the night. Afterwards the
Gamar&#257;la having gone there [to watch for the thief] went to sleep.
In the hand of the Gamar&#257;la there was a lump of salt chillies.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Leopard came at night. The Leopard lifting each goat
looks at it. Having looked, afterwards having lifted up the
Gamar&#257;la [and found he was the heaviest] he took him. Carrying him
away he took him to his rock cave. Then the Gamar&#257;la quickly
[entered it, and] shut the door. The Leopard then was trying to go into
the cave. Having heard the uproar the Jackal Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257;
came. &ldquo;What is this, Sapu-flowers&rsquo; Minister, you are
doing?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other years I brought goats [and ate them without
trouble]. That one having entered the cave has shut the
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Sir, having put your tail inside the cave be pleased to
wave it,&rdquo; he said; the Jackal Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257; said.
&ldquo;Do not catch hold of the tail,&rdquo; he said [to the
Gamar&#257;la]. &ldquo;Otherwise, having put thy foot against the wall,
and having folded it two-fold or three-fold, hold it [fast],&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Do not jam a little of the golden salt chillies under the
tail of the Sapu-flowers&rsquo; Minister,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then the Gamar&#257;la having seized the tail jammed in the salt
chillies. Afterwards the Sapu-flowers&rsquo; Minister pulling out his
tail bounded away. Having bounded off and gone, he sat down on a flat
rock. Afterwards the Jackal Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257; asked,
&ldquo;What are you on that flat rock for?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name="pb368">368</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking if this country is fruitful or
unfruitful,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10174src" href=
"#xd26e10174" name="xd26e10174src">1</a> he said.</p>
<p>Again, the Gamar&#257;la, saving his life, went to the village. The
Jackal Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257; went to the Gamar&#257;la.
&ldquo;What is it, Gamar&#257;la? Couldn&rsquo;t you kill
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While he was outside how could I, sitting in the cave, kill
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you a trick for that one,&rdquo; the Jackal
Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257; said. Afterwards he said, &ldquo;You must
make a trap for that one,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall I make the trap?&rdquo; [the Gamar&#257;la]
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the fence of the goat-fold,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Afterwards he made the trap. The Sapu-flowers&rsquo; Minister was
noosed in the trap. On the following day the Gamar&#257;la came to
look. Having come before the Gamar&#257;la, also the Jackal
Pa&#7751;&#7693;itay&#257; came near the trap. &ldquo;Gamar&#257;la,
to-day indeed he has been hanged,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Part of this story was given in <span class="bibl"><i>The

Leopard which was trying to get at a man who had taken refuge in a corn
store, advised it to insert its tail through a gap in the doorway, and
wave it about. When it did so, the Jackal said in the
Peraelib&#257;sa,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10230src" href=

<h2 class="main">How the Boars killed the R&#257;kshasa</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a certain city. There is a very great jungle
belonging to the city. A wild Sow stays in the jungle. The Sow having
come to a house on the high ground, and pains having come to her, gave
birth to a little Boar. The men of the house having seen the little
Boar, catching it and amply giving it to eat, reared it.</p>
<p>[After he had grown up], one day that village Boar says, &ldquo;I
cannot remain thus.&rdquo; Having thought, &ldquo;I must go to a great
jungle,&rdquo; he went away.</p>
<p>After that, having gone to the jungle, while he was there a
R&#257;kshasa having come to that jungle was eating the large Boars.
Afterwards the village Boar said [to the others], &ldquo;I will tell
you a good trick,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the other large Boars in the jungle
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please dig two very large wells. At the bottom make the two
wells one,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10292src" href=
"#xd26e10292" name="xd26e10292src">1</a> he said. &ldquo;The large
village Boar will be [on the ground] in the middle of the two
wells,&rdquo; he said. He told the other large Boars to be round the
well.</p>
<p>The R&#257;kshasa every day comes to a rock. The large village Boar
asks the other large Boars, &ldquo;This R&#257;kshasa having come, what
will you do as he comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Boars say, &ldquo;This R&#257;kshasa having come makes
grimaces at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then ye also make grimaces,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, he inflates his sides at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye also inflate your sides,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He makes a very great roar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ye also at that time roar all together,&rdquo; he said.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the following day the R&#257;kshasa having come, and having
looked in the direction of the Boars, made grimaces, inflated his
sides, and made a very great roar. [The Boars did the same.]</p>
<p>Then the R&#257;kshasa thought, &ldquo;To-day these Boars will eat
me.&rdquo; Thinking this he went near the Lion.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Lion scolded him. &ldquo;An&#275;! You also having
gone, and having been unable [to do anything], have you come
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to do? All that I do the Boars are
doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the R&#257;kshasa again came to the place where the Boars
were. After that, the village great Boar says to the other Boars,
&ldquo;To-day the R&#257;kshasa is coming to eat us indeed. What shall
we do?&rdquo; he said to the great Boars. &ldquo;[This is what we will
do.] The R&#257;kshasa having come, when he springs at the great Boars
I will jump into the well. Having jumped in, I will come to the ground
by the tunnel [and the other well],&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Before I
ascend you eat the R&#257;kshasa,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In that way the R&#257;kshasa came. Having come, as he was springing
[at the Boar] the Boar jumped into the well. Then the R&#257;kshasa
having jumped [in after him] they bit him and ate him up.</p>
<p>Afterwards the great village Boar asked the other Boars, &ldquo;Who
else is there to eat your flesh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, &ldquo;Still there is a Lion King,&rdquo; they said. Saying,
&ldquo;A&#7693;&#257;! Seeking him there, let us all go,&rdquo; they
all went.</p>
<p>The Lion King as the Boars were coming climbed up a tree. Then the
Boars at once having broken the roots of the tree, felled the tree to
the ground. The Lion ran away.</p>
<p>Then the Boars, saying, &ldquo;Seize him, seize him!&rdquo; having
gone chasing him, killed the Lion.</p>

<p class="first">This tale is given in the <span class=

reared by a carpenter joined the wild ones, and taught them how to kill
a Tiger that devoured them, by means of two pits. The tunnel connecting
them is omitted. The Boar did not jump into the pit; &lsquo;only the
Tiger fell into one of the pits when he sprang at the Boar. After
killing the Tiger they proceeded to kill a sham <span class=

<p>Although the Ro&#7693;iy&#257;s are not often present at the
services at the Buddhist temples, they go to them occasionally, not,
however, being permitted to enter the temple enclosure, but standing
outside it. There they can hear the reading of the sacred books
(<i lang="si-latn">ba&#7751;a</i>), and perhaps in this manner they
have learnt the story of the Boars. I have not met with it as a
folk-tale elsewhere. The reference to the tunnel connecting the two
pits shows that it has independent features. This tunnel alone explains
the excavation of the two pits, one to jump into and the other to
escape by. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain village there was a boy who looked after
cattle. One day, in the morning having taken the cattle [to graze], as
they were going to water, that boy, when a python seizing a Jackal was
going to eat it, went and beat the python, saying, &ldquo;An&#275;!
This python is going to eat the Jackal, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the python having let the Jackal go seized the boy. So the boy
cried out, &ldquo;&#256;n&#7693;&#257;! &#256;n&#7693;&#257;! O my
father! The python has seized me!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Then the Jackal having come running, when he looked [saw that] the
python had caught the boy, and thinking &ldquo;A&#7693;&#257;! Because
of me this one seized the boy,&rdquo; the Jackal looking and looking
backwards, ran off [to fetch assistance]. After he had looked [to see]
if there was any one, there was no one. The Jackal heard several people
in the distance. The Jackal went running there. When he was going near
the men, the men said, &ldquo;A mad Jackal has come,&rdquo; they
said.</p>
<p>Then again the Jackal came running to the place where the python
was. Again he came running to the place where the men were. Having come
[there], after the Jackal looked [he saw that] the clothes of men who
were bathing were under a tree. The Jackal having gone to the place
where the clothes were, taking a waist cloth in his mouth ran off.
Having run off, and having put down the cloth at the place where the
python, holding the boy, was staying, the Jackal ran into the
jungle.</p>
<p>Then those men having seen that the Jackal which had taken the cloth
in its mouth was running away, saying, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

cloth in its mouth is running away,&rdquo; followed the Jackal. When
they looked, having seen that the python had seized the boy, they said,
&ldquo;A&#7693;&#257;! The python has caught such and such a
one&rsquo;s boy and encircled him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then those men who were ploughing and ploughing having all come
running, and having beaten and thrown down the python, saved the boy.
[Afterwards] those men asked at the hand of the boy, &ldquo;What did
the python seize thee for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the boy said, &ldquo;As I was coming the python had seized the
Jackal, and I was sorry. At that time I tried to save the Jackal, and
that one having let the Jackal go, seized me.&rdquo;</p>

having cut a Damunu<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10389src" href=
"#xd26e10389" name="xd26e10389src">1</a> tree, and removed the
splinters, and put it down to the bottom of a well, and tied a creeper
noose to the Damunu stick, you are to draw it up [from inside the well]
to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards the Yak&#257; having cut a well of seven fathoms, and cut
a Damunu tree, and removed the bark from it, and tied a creeper noose
to it, and put the Damunu stick to the bottom of the well, the
Yak&#257; sitting on the ground holding the creeper noose tried to draw
it out. He could not draw it. When he was drawing it, because there was
slime on the Damunu stick he was unable to draw it out.</p>
<p>On account of the time during which the Yak&#257; had been delayed
near the well, the monk being afraid of the Yak&#257;, the monk went
backwards and backwards for three gawwas (twelve miles). The Yak&#257;
having pushed against the monk for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb376"
href="#pb376" name="pb376">376</a>]</span>so much time, and having got
a bill-hook also, on the road he drove him (the monk) away. Having gone
there [afterwards] to kill the monk, he met with the monk. After that,
the Yak&#257; threw the bill-hook, so that having cut the monk with it
he would die. After he had thrown it, the bill-hook was
behind,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10399src" href="#xd26e10399" name=
"xd26e10399src">2</a> and the monk was in front [of it]. On account of
that, the name [of the place] there became Kaett&#257;&#275;pahuwa [a
village twenty-one miles from Kurun&#257;&#275;gala, on the road to
Anur&#257;dhapura].</p>

<p class="first">This story is known throughout the district to the
north of Kurun&#257;&#275;gala. The explanation of the Damunu tree
incident which was given to me is that the monk, being unable to find
enough work for the Yak&#257;, gave him this task as one that would
provide occupation for him for a long time. When the bark is freshly
removed, the Damunu sticks are extremely slippery. The creeper was tied
at one end in a ring which was passed over the smooth stem of the tree.
When the Yak&#257; endeavoured to raise the tree by pulling at the
creeper, the ring slipped up the stem instead of raising the tree.</p>

<p class="first">Elsewhere in the same district I heard of another man,
a villager, who had mastered a Yaksan&#299; (female Yak&#257;), and who
made her perform work for him. In appearance she was an ordinary
female, and the man&rsquo;s wife was unaware of her true character, as
he had not informed her of it, being afraid of alarming her. The man
kept the Yaksan&#299; under control by means of a magic iron nail,
which he had driven in the crown of her head. One day during his
absence she went to her mistress, and told her that a thorn had run
into her head while she was carrying firewood on it, and that she was
unable to draw it out. The woman extracted the nail for her, and the
Yaksan&#299;, being then free, killed the family, and escaped.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain country dwelt a man and a woman, it is
said. These two had a son and a daughter.</p>
<p>When a man came one day and asked for the daughter [in marriage] at
the hand of the father, the father said, &ldquo;It is good. Come on
Wednesday.&rdquo; The man having said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; went
away.</p>
<p>Afterwards another man came and asked for the girl at the hand of
the mother. The mother said, &ldquo;It is good. Come on
Wednesday.&rdquo; The man having said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; went
away.</p>
<p>After that, yet a man came and asked for her at the hand of the
girl&rsquo;s younger brother. The younger brother said, &ldquo;It is
good. Come on Wednesday.&rdquo; The man having said
&ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; went away.</p>
<p>Well then, the company of three persons having come on Wednesday and
eaten rice and betel, caused the girl to come out [of the house],
inviting her to go. Then the three persons endeavoured to call her to
go in three [different] directions. Because the girl was unable to
settle the dispute she ate a kind of poison, and lying down died there
and then. Afterwards they buried her.</p>
<p>After that, the man who came first went to a sooth-sayer. The man
who came next watched alone at the place where they buried her. The man
who came last having said, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me,&rdquo;
went to his village.</p>
<p>The man who went to ask for sooth having inquired about it, came to
the place where they buried the girl. Having come and made incantations
in the manner prescribed by the sooth-sayer, he made her arise, and got
her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>[back to life]. After she had recovered she went
to the village. The man also went there.</p>
<p>Now then, after the three men had come together there, the man who
brought her back to life asked, &ldquo;To whom do you
belong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl said, &ldquo;The man who watched alone at the grave is my
mother. The man who went to inquire of the sooth-sayer is my father.
The man who went to his village is my man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, the girl went with the man to his village.</p>

<p class="first">This is a story of Vikrama and the Vampire, one of the
puzzling questions set to the King being a decision as to whom the girl
belonged.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Nights&rsquo; Entertainment</i>
(Swynnerton), p. 237</span>, the girl threw herself down from the
house-top. One of the suitors sprang on the funeral pile, and was burnt
with her. The second watched over the grave. The third became a
Fak&#299;r, and learnt how to revive the dead. He revived both the girl
and the burnt suitor. The merchant whose opinion was required decided
that the two who were burnt together were brother and sister, the
Fak&#299;r who gave them renewed life was their father, and the man who
merely sat by the grave must become her husband.</p>
<p>In the J&#257;taka story No. 150 (vol. i, p. 321), there is an
account of a person who had learnt the spell for reviving the dead. In
this case it was a tiger, who killed him.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Tot&#257; Kah&#257;n&#299;</i> (Small), p.
139</span>, out of three suitors for the hand of a girl who was carried
off by a fairy, one learnt the manner of her disappearance and the
place where she was, the second made a magical flying wooden horse, on
which the third rode to rescue her, killed the fairy, and brought her
back. The Parrot&rsquo;s decision was that the last one had the best
right to her, as he had risked his life for her. <span class=

<p class="first">In a river in a certain country a Crocodile stayed, it
is said. While it was living there, the Crocodile having become
friendly with a Crab, the Crocodile said to the Crab, &ldquo;Friend,
you call the Jackal to drink water, so that I may seize and eat the
Jackal after he has come.&rdquo; The Crab said
&ldquo;H&#257;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the bank of that river there were Muruta<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10493src" href="#xd26e10493" name="xd26e10493src">1</a> trees,
and there were flowers on those Muruta trees. The Crocodile said to the
Crab, &ldquo;I will lie down on the high ground. You bring flowers that
have fallen below those Muruta trees and cover me.&rdquo; Having said
[this], the Crocodile lay down on the high ground near the water, and
the Crab having brought the Muruta flowers covered the Crocodile.</p>
<p>Having covered him, the Crab, calling the Jackal, came to drink
water. The Crocodile stayed as though dead. Then the Jackal having come
near the Crocodile said, &ldquo;In our country, indeed, dead Crocodiles
wag their tails. This Crocodile, why doesn&rsquo;t he wag his tail?
Maybe he isn&rsquo;t dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then that Crocodile which remained as though dead, wagged his tail.
After that, the Jackal, without stopping even to drink water, bounded
off, and went away.</p>
<p>Afterwards the Crocodile said to the Crab, &ldquo;Friend, to-morrow
I will stop at the bottom of the water. You come there with the Jackal.
Then I will seize and eat him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Crab having said &ldquo;H&#257;,&rdquo; on the following day
came with the Jackal to the place where the Crocodile was. Then the
Crocodile seized the Jackal by the foot [as he was going to drink
water]. The Jackal said&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381"

also without drinking water he bounded off, and went away.</p>
<p>From that day, the Jackals having become angry with the Crabs, and
having seized and bitten the Crabs in the rice fields, place the
Crabs&rsquo; claws on the earthen ridges in the fields.</p>

<p class="first">In <span class="bibl"><i>The Orientalist</i>, vol. ii,
p. 46</span>, there is a story of a Jackal and a Crocodile, in the
latter part of which the first incident is given, the tree being a
Veralu (<i lang="la">Elaeocarpus serratus</i>). The Crab is not
introduced into it.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bibl">J&#257;taka story No. 57 (vol. i, p.
142)</span> a Crocodile endeavoured to entrap a Monkey by lying still
on the top of a rock. The Monkey, suspecting some trick, from the
unusual height of the rock, addressed the rock and inquired why it did
not reply as usual. The Crocodile then spoke.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Indian Folk Tales</i> (Gordon), p.
63</span>, the God Mah&#257;deo (&#346;iva) took the place of the
Crocodile, in order to be revenged on the Jackal for cheating him in
the matter of the dead elephant (see No. 39, note); and the two
incidents of the shamming death and seizure of the root are
related.</p>
<p>In <span class="bibl"><i>Old Deccan Days</i> (Frere) p. 310</span>,
a Jackal escaped from an Alligator [Crocodile] in the same manner.

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VILLAGE FOLK TALES--CEYLON, VOL 1 ***

***** This file should be named 56614-h.htm or 56614-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg (This file was produced from images generously
made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
